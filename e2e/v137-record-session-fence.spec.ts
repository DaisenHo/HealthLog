/**
 * The record-session fence, in a real browser.
 *
 * `e2e/v137-sharing-cross-tab-session.spec.ts` proves the COOPERATIVE layer:
 * a peer tab holds while the initiator's switch is in flight, because the
 * initiator told it to. This file proves the cases that layer cannot reach —
 * the ones where nobody tells anybody anything:
 *
 *   * FENCE-AC-01 peers reconcile to the exact new epoch and scope, not merely
 *     to "something changed";
 *   * FENCE-AC-02 the initiator's response never arrives, because the tab is
 *     torn off mid-flight;
 *   * FENCE-AC-03 the initiator is CLOSED after the server committed, so no
 *     commit broadcast is ever published;
 *   * FENCE-AC-06 a record response delayed across the switch is discarded by
 *     the client rather than painted;
 *   * FENCE-AC-07 the disk layers — CacheStorage and the service worker's
 *     `healthlog-data-*` — cannot serve one record's bytes inside another.
 *
 * ## Why every absence assertion here is paired
 *
 * "The peer never showed the owner's data" passes on a page that is
 * permanently wedged, which is a worse outcome than the bug. So each of those
 * legs additionally asserts the peer REACHES a usable state on the target
 * scope once `/me` resolves. An absence-only assertion in this file would be a
 * check that cannot fail.
 *
 * Uses the existing synthetic `e2e/setup` fixtures; introduces no new account
 * anchors.
