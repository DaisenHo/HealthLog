/**
 * What a browser has to prove about v1.37 sharing, enumerated.
 *
 * Two lists, and both exist for the same reason: a browser suite reports what
 * it ran, never what it did not. A state nobody wrote a test for and a journey
 * somebody quietly dropped both look like a green run. Naming them in one
 * place that a fast test reads back turns "we cover the error state" from a
 * claim in a summary into something that fails.
 *
 * Nothing here drives a browser. The enumeration is the contract; the spec is
 * the implementation, and `src/__tests__/sharing-accessibility-states.test.ts`
 * is what holds the two together.
