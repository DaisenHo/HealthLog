/**
 * v1.37 — the level-A blocks the assistant actually receives.
 *
 * This calls `extractFeatures`, the shipped composition, against real rows in
 * real Postgres. The unit test beside it (`mood-staleness.test.ts`) rebuilds
 * the block shape from the pure calculator, which proves the calculator and
 * the freshness rule agree — but it never imports `features.ts`, so on its own
 * it would stay green if the builder hardcoded `current: true`, dropped
 * `staleNotice`, or stopped attaching `dimensions` at all. Both ends and the
 * pipe between them: this is the pipe.
 *
 * The fixture is the one the phase exists for. A person taps a face every
 * morning and opens the sliders once a week, so pleasantness is from today and
 * stress is six days old. One of those may back a present-tense sentence and
 * the other may not.
