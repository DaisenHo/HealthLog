/**
 * Counts the SQL statements the application sends to Postgres while a
 * function runs.
 *
 * Every statement the Prisma client sends goes through `pg`'s
 * `Client.prototype.query` (the driver adapter's pool hands out `pg`
 * clients, raw queries included, transactions' BEGIN/COMMIT included). The
 * prototype is patched once, on the `pg` instance the adapter itself
 * resolves, so a second copy of `pg` elsewhere in node_modules cannot leave
 * the counter reading zero; `countStatements` refuses a window that saw no
 * statement at all for the same reason.
 *
 * Background work a request starts and does not await (the fire-and-forget
 * tasks) is settled before the window closes, so it is counted with the
 * request that caused it.
