/**
 * Unit-test setup.
 *
 * Seed the client-side locale cache with every message bundle. In
 * production only EN ships statically; the active locale arrives as an
 * RSC prop from the root layout and other locales load via dynamic
 * import on switch (see `src/lib/i18n/load-locale.ts`). Tests mount
 * `I18nProvider` standalone — often with `renderToStaticMarkup`, which
 * is synchronous and cannot await a dynamic import — so the cache is
 * primed up front and `t()` resolves every locale on the first render,
 * exactly like the server-handoff path does in the app.

/**
 * Leave no background work in flight when a test ends.

 * detached handle so the failure is not swallowed. Vitest forwards every
 * console write to the main thread as an `onUserConsoleLog` RPC call and
 * rejects whatever is still pending on that channel while it tears a test file
 * down, so a write that lands in that window fails the whole run with
 * `EnvironmentTeardownError: Closing rpc while "onUserConsoleLog" was pending`
 * — blamed on the file the worker was tearing down, which is not the test that
 * started the work and need not log anything of its own. Awaiting the
 * registered tasks here removes the precondition instead of muting the
 * console, which would have thrown away a real signal and left the
 * non-determinism in place. See `src/lib/logging/background-tasks.ts`.
