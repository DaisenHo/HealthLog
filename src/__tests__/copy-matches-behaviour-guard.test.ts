/**
 * Copy-matches-behaviour guard.
 *
 * Four classes of copy that must not drift away from the code they describe,
 * each pinned here so the pair fails loudly if either half moves. The first
 * three are repairs — copy that had already drifted. The fourth arrives with
 * the feature it governs, because a wording rule that depends on review is a
 * wording rule that survives until the fifth locale.
 *
 *   1. DELETE CONFIRMATIONS. A confirmation is the moment a user weighs the
 *      consequence. Four dialogs promised permanence on surfaces that render
 *      an Undo affordance (measurements bulk, mood bulk, labs, illness) — a
 *      cautious user declines a safe delete, and the warning loses weight
 *      where it is true. This test pins both directions: undo-able surfaces
 *      must offer the undo sentence and must NOT claim finality; the
 *      genuinely permanent ones must keep their warning.
 *
 *   2. SLEEP DEBT. v1.19.0 replaced the summed shortfall with a running
 *      balance that credits surplus sleep. The labels still described the old
 *      arithmetic, so the word contradicted the number for anyone who caught
 *      up after a short night.
 *
 *   3. GLUCOSE REFERENCE BAND. The declared diabetes opt-in has a server
 *      preference and a route; the copy for its web control must exist in
 *      every locale, since a missing key silently degrades to the raw key on
 *      a surface that makes a clinical-adjacent claim.
 *
 * Reversibility evidence for the undo-able set:
 *   - measurements: `POST /api/measurements/restore`, undo toast in
 *     `src/components/measurements/measurement-list.tsx`
 *   - mood:         `POST /api/mood-entries/restore`, undo toast in
 *     `src/components/mood/mood-list.tsx`
 *   - labs:         `POST /api/labs/restore`, undo toast in
 *     `src/components/labs/lab-history-list.tsx`
 *   - illness:      `POST /api/illness/episodes/[id]/restore`, undo toast in
 *     `src/components/illness/episode-menu.tsx`
