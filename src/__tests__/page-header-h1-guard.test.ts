/**
 * A module page's title is a `PageHeader` (UI standards §1, §5): the H1 on
 * one tier (`text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight`), its explainer muted under
 * it, its actions beside it.
 *
 * Four in-app headings were hand-rolled beside it — the insights sub-page
 * shell (`text-xl sm:text-2xl font-semibold`), the medication detail, the
 * check-in and its result (`font-semibold`) — and each read a step lighter
 * than every other page title. They go through `PageHeader` now; this guard
 * keeps a new `<h1>` literal from appearing outside the places where a
 * different heading is the point.
 *
 * Matched: an `<h1` tag in JSX under `src/components` and `src/app`, with
 * comments stripped first, so a file that only talks about an H1 needs no
 * entry and every entry below is a heading that is actually rendered.
