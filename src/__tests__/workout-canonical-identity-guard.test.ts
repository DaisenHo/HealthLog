/**
 * Structural guard on the canonical-workout session identity.
 *
 * `pickCanonicalWorkoutRows()` collapses a HealthKit session that arrived more
 * than once under different external UUIDs. It can only do that when the row it
 * is handed carries the identity fields, and the row shape comes from each
 * caller's own Prisma `select`. Nothing in the type system connects the two:
 * `durationSec` is optional on `WorkoutPickerRow`, so a caller that omits it
 * gets silent passthrough rather than a compile error.
 *
 * That is exactly what happened. When the collapse first shipped, the key was
 * `(sportType, startedAt, endedAt, durationSec)` and only the workout list
 * selected `endedAt`. The list showed one workout while the Coach narrated the
 * duplicate, the per-sport baseline averaged it twice and the deep-link cluster
 * kept both rows. One record, four surfaces, two answers.
 *
 * These are tripwires, not proofs. They cannot show the collapse is correct —
 * that is what the unit tests do. What they can do is refuse to let a new call
 * site join the set without someone editing this file, and refuse to let the
 * identity quietly grow a field that only some callers fetch.
