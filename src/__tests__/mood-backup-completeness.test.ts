/**
 * Pair guard binding `prisma/schema.prisma`'s `MoodEntry`,
 * `MoodEntryTagLink` and `MoodContext` models to the disaster-recovery backup
 * selects.
 *
 * The sibling of `measurement-backup-completeness.test.ts`, written as its own
 * file rather than as a second describe inside it, because that guard's own
 * note asks for model-by-model growth and one file per model keeps every
 * failure message about one model.
 *
 * The failure it exists to catch, stated by the defect that prompted it: the
 * mood payload carried `id, date, mood, score, tags, source, loggedAt,
 * externalId, deletedAt, factors` and nothing else. The free-text note, the
 * row's timezone and the last-writer-wins counter were selected by the query
 * and written to no payload, so a restored entry came back without its text,
 * read its day boundaries under the legacy Europe/Berlin assumption, and lost
 * the next sync round to a paired device still holding a higher counter. The
 * backup validation schema is `.passthrough()`, so nothing complained at parse
 * time either. Nothing here was a wrong value; every one of them was silence.
 *
 * Both ends of the comparison are literals — a Prisma model block and a named
 * select object — so the matcher is exact. Every matcher also asserts a
 * non-zero match count: an empty match set fails rather than passing quietly,
 * which is how the bearer-scope guard stayed green for months while matching
 * nothing at all.
 *
 * Mutation check: comment out `tz: true` in `MOOD_ENTRY_BACKUP_SELECT` and
 * this goes red naming that column; add a scalar to the model without adding
 * it to the select and it goes red naming the new one; rename the mapper's
 * `moodEntry` parameter and the serialization assertion goes red on all of
 * them at once. The same three hold for `MOOD_CONTEXT_BACKUP_SELECT` and the
 * `moodContext` mapper parameter beside it.
