/**
 * The shape of `prisma/schema.prisma` the two wipe guards read.
 *
 * Both of them ask the same two questions — which models carry a `userId`, and
 * which models the database removes on its own when a row they do delete goes
 * — so the parser answering them lives in one place. Two copies would drift,
 * and a guard that answers from its own private idea of the schema is a guard
 * that can be green for the wrong reason.
 *
 * Deliberately regex-shaped rather than a real parser: it runs inside
 * `pnpm test` with no database and no Prisma engine, and model blocks plus
 * field lines are the most stable syntax in the file. Every consumer asserts a
 * floor on how much it found, so a parser that silently stops matching fails
 * loudly instead of passing vacuously.
