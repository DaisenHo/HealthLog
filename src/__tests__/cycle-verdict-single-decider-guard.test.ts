/**
 * One decider for the cycle verdict.
 *
 * The server resolves the cycle day, the ring's arcs, the fertile-window state
 * and the overdue judgement with its day count, and publishes them on
 * `GET /api/cycle/calendar`. Client code renders that. It does not recompute
 * any part of it, and it does not keep its own grace-period constant — while
 * such a constant exists in client code it can be copied into another client,
 * which is exactly how a cycle ring came to show a person a day their record
 * did not hold.
 *
 * Two halves, because either one alone is satisfiable by broken code:
 * nothing in the client tree may derive the verdict, AND the surfaces that
 * show it must still be reading the published field.
