/**
 * Structural guard binding `prisma/schema.prisma` to the "Delete All Data"
 * wipe plan.
 *
 * The failure it exists to catch: a model is added to the schema, it is
 * user-scoped from birth, and the wipe list is "the follow-up". Nothing fails
 * — the route keeps deleting what it always deleted, the toast keeps saying
 * "all personal data has been deleted", and the new table quietly joins the
 * set of things that survive a confirmation the person typed by hand. That is
 * how a 13-table wipe ended up facing an 80-table schema.
 *
 * Both ends are literals — Prisma model blocks on one side, exported arrays
 * and objects on the other — so the matcher is exact. Nothing here greps for
 * intent.
 *
 * What it proves:
 *   1. every model carrying a `userId` column is either wiped or exempt with a
 *      reason;
 *   2. every model without one either reaches a wiped model through a chain of
 *      required `onDelete: Cascade` relations (so the database removes it) or
 *      is declared instance-scoped;
 *   3. every `User` column is either reset or kept with a reason;
 *   4. the delete order lists children before parents, so the per-model counts
 *      in the audit row are truthful;
 *   5. no exemption has gone stale.
 *
 * Its honest limit: it proves classification, not judgement. It cannot tell
 * that a model was put on the exempt list for a bad reason — only that
 * somebody had to write a reason down. And it reads relations, so a table
 * linked to an account by a bare `userId` string with no foreign key (there
 * are two: `TelegramScheduledDeletion`, `TelegramPromptContext`) is caught by
 * rule 1 only because the column name matches the convention.
 *
 * Mutation check: remove any entry from `WIPE_MODELS` and this goes red naming
 * that model; add a column to `model User` without classifying it and it goes
 * red naming the column.
