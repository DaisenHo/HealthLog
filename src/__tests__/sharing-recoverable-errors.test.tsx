/**
 * A refused sharing action says what happened, stays on screen, and can be
 * tried again.
 *
 * ## The state this file exists to prevent
 *
 * Three of the four mutations on the shared-access panel had no failure
 * rendering at all. `accept`, `revoke` and `renounce` fired, the request came
 * back 409 or 410 or never left the machine, and the panel did nothing: the
 * dialog had already closed, the list did not change, and the only signal was
 * the absence of one. The two refusals that matter most were exactly the two
 * that arrived silently — an invitation that had lapsed, and the last Guardian
 * being told they may not walk away from a profile that would then have nobody
 * looking after it. Both are recoverable, and neither was recoverable if
 * nobody knew it had happened.
 *
 * ## Why the failure lives on the mutation and not in a `useState`
 *
 * A local `useState` set from `onError` is a second copy of a fact TanStack
 * already holds, and the copy is the thing that goes stale: a re-render from
 * an unrelated invalidation clears it, or a second failure overwrites the
 * first row's message onto another row. `isError` / `error` / `variables`
 * survive on the mutation until something explicitly resets it, and
 * `variables` is what says WHICH row failed. That is also what makes this file
 * possible — the panel's failure states are reachable from a static render,
 * with no click, because they are props rather than the result of an
 * interaction.
 *
 * ## What a static render can and cannot prove
 *
 * It proves the alert exists, is announced, is addressed to the right row,
 * carries content contrast rather than muted meta, sits beside a retry control
 * and leaves the row's own affordances in place. It does NOT prove the retry
 * button re-fires the mutation with the same argument — there is no click
 * here. That claim is the browser journey's, and the pure resolver below is
 * where the mapping from a refusal to a sentence is actually pinned.
