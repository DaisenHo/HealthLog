/**
 * A link to a visit is built by `src/lib/encounters/visit-links.ts`, and a
 * bare `/checkups` is a link to the checkups, never to a visit.
 *
 * Visits are the second tab of `/checkups`. The bare path opens the first
 * one, the preventive-care list, which never lists an appointment. Four
 * surfaces showed an upcoming appointment and linked it to the bare path —
 * the dashboard's next-appointment line, the Today rail item, the Today
 * overview fact and the appointment's push — so a tap on the appointment
 * landed on the list it is not on. Each had spelled the path by hand.
 *
 * Two rules, both over code lines (comments are skipped):
 *
 *  1. The visit and tab query forms (`/checkups?visit=`, `/checkups?view=`)
 *     appear only in the builder.
 *  2. The bare `/checkups` literal appears only where the target IS the
 *     checkups list, counted per file. A new occurrence fails the run until
 *     someone decides whether it names a checkup (add it here, with the
 *     reason) or a visit (use the builder).
 *
 * Not matched, stated rather than hidden: a path assembled from parts
 * (`"/check" + "ups"`), and a `/*` inside a string on the same line as the
 * literal, which the comment skipper reads as a comment.
