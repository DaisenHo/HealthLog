/**
 * What the product SAYS a manage grant cannot reach agrees with what it cannot
 * reach.
 *
 * Two sentences make that promise, and both were written when it was true:
 *
 *   * the `access` field's description in the sharing request schema, which is
 *     generated into `docs/api/openapi.yaml` and read by the native client —
 *     it said MANAGE "never reaches … settings";
 *   * `recordSharing.unavailable.description`, the paragraph a delegate meets
 *     on a page sharing does not cover — it said settings "stay with the
 *     person who owns the account".
 *
 * v1.37.0 opened one Settings destination to a manage grant, and both
 * sentences became false in the most expensive place a sentence can be false:
 * one is a consent screen, the other is a published contract. A promise that
 * has quietly stopped holding is worse than no promise, because somebody has
 * already decided based on it.
 *
 * So the copy is checked against the classification rather than against
 * itself. If a second destination is ever opened, or the anamnesis one is
 * closed again, the sentence that describes the boundary has to move with it.
 *
 * What this cannot check is whether the wording is GOOD. It checks that the
 * absolute claim is gone, that the boundary is named the way the code draws it
 * (record content versus account configuration), and that all six locales say
 * it — which is the part that rots silently.
