/**
 * v1.18.0 — operator-level server-wide module availability.
 *
 * The SECOND layer of the two-layer module model. The first layer is the
 * per-user opt-out (`User.modulePreferencesJson`, resolved in
 * `./gate.ts`); this layer is the operator's server-wide kill-switch
 * (`AppSettings.moduleAvailabilityJson`). A module the operator turns off
 * is off for EVERY account regardless of that account's personal
 * preference — exactly mirroring how the coach master flag
 * (`assistant_coach_enabled`) sits above the per-user `User.disableCoach`.
 *
 * Persisted shape: a DISABLED allowlist, identical in semantics to the
 * per-user blob —
 *
 *   - NULL / empty / key absent  ⇒ available
 *   - key present & `false`       ⇒ disabled server-wide
 *   - key present & `true`        ⇒ available (redundant-but-allowed)
 *
 * Default-available, no backfill: a fresh / upgraded instance keeps every
 * module available until an operator flips one off.
 *
 * Fail-open posture: a null column, a malformed blob, an unknown key, or a
 * read error all resolve to "available". Only an explicit, well-typed
 * `false` for a known toggleable key disables a module server-wide. This
 * matches the per-user resolver's posture so a storage glitch never
 * silently hides a domain from the whole server.
 *
 * CORE domains (weight, BP, pulse, medications) are NOT `ModuleKey`s, are
 * never written here, and the admin write endpoint refuses them — the
 * measurement engine + meds can never be disabled.
 *
 * The Coach is the one module whose operator layer does not live in the blob.
 * The operator has exactly one Coach switch, `AppSettings.assistantCoachEnabled`
 * (master applied), and the Coach's availability here IS that switch. Two
 * operator Coach switches meant two places to look for one answer; migration
 * 0343 folded the blob's `coach` key into the switch and removed it, and a
 * `coach` key that still turns up in the blob is ignored.
