/**
 * The shared builder for the user-scoped full-backup payload.
 *
 * Extracted so both the plaintext `GET /api/export/full-backup` route and the
 * passphrase-encrypted `POST /api/export/encrypted` route emit the byte-for-byte
 * same shape — the one that the pg-boss `data-backup` worker writes and that
 * `parseBackupPayload()` round-trips on admin restore. Keep this writer in sync
 * with the `data-backup` worker (`src/lib/jobs/reminder-worker.ts`).
 *
 * The decrypted notes are surfaced here (the backup is the human-readable
 * artefact); an admin restore re-encrypts them on re-insert.
 *
 * Two writers read this file, not one. `buildFullBackupPayload` materialises
 * the whole payload, which is what the two export routes and every test want.
 * `streamFullBackupJson` (`full-backup-stream.ts`) asks for the same payload
 * with `deferBulk`, which leaves the unbounded tables (and the two whose rows
 * carry stored bytes) as markers and pulls their rows through itself — the
 * weekly job takes that path because materialising a large record is what
 * used to exhaust the container's heap. Both go through the same per-row
 * serialisers, each in its domain's module, so a column that reaches one
 * reaches the other; the integration suite pins the two outputs byte for
 * byte rather than trusting that sentence.
