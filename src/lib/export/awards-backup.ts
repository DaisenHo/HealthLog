/**
 * What the account EARNED: its personal bests and its unlocked badges, with
 * both backup ends in one file.
 *
 * Same arrangement as `reminders-backup.ts` and `coach-backup.ts`, for the same
 * reason: a reader asking "is this carried at both ends?" answers it here, and
 * a reader who greps only the restore ROUTE gets a false negative because the
 * route delegates.
 *
 * Two models ride. The register called the bests "recomputable in principle
 * from measurements and workouts, but nothing recomputes them today, so in
 * practice they are lost", and the badges "milestones the account earned, with
 * the date each was reached. The date is the part that cannot be recovered".
 * Both entries understate it slightly, and the difference is worth writing
 * down because it decides what this file has to carry.
 *
 * ## Neither one is really recomputable
 *
 * A best is a claim about a history, and the history a restored account has is
 * not the one the best was found in. Workout sample series and GPS routes do
 * not travel at all (disclosed in the file's own manifest), a portable export
 * omits soft-deleted measurements, and a record found in a reading that has
 * since been corrected can never be found again. So a "recomputation" would
 * not reproduce these rows; it would produce different ones and call them the
 * same.
 *
 * The badge is worse, because the date is load-bearing and half the dates have
 * no source left. `achievements-result.ts` merges persisted unlock dates with
 * dates it can still derive, and persisted wins. Several metrics it derives
 * from are things this backup deliberately does not carry: passkey and
 * password login counts, the doctor-PDF and locale-flip counters. Drop the
 * rows and those badges do not come back with an older date; they come back
 * with today's, or they relock.
 *
 * ## The one reference that can take the whole restore down
 *
 * `PersonalRecord.sourceMeasurementId` looks like a bare id column in
 * `prisma/schema.prisma`, which declares no relation for it. The DATABASE
 * disagrees: migration 0054 created it as
 * `REFERENCES "measurements"("id") ON DELETE SET NULL`, so it is a real
 * foreign key that the Prisma client does not know about.
 *
 * That is the dangerous combination rather than the harmless one. The client
 * writes whatever value it is handed, and Postgres refuses the statement,
 * which rolls back the whole transaction and returns an account with NOTHING
 * in it over a single provenance pointer. The mood categories were the same
 * shape of defect measured a release earlier: a 500 and an empty account.
 *
 * So the restore resolves the pointer against the measurements it actually
 * wrote, NULLS what it cannot resolve, and reports the miss. Nulling rather
 * than dropping is the point: the record itself is the historical fact, which
 * is exactly why the column was declared `ON DELETE SET NULL` in the first
 * place. Losing the pointer costs an audit trail nothing reads; losing the row
 * costs a best that cannot be found again.
 *
 * The ordinary way a pointer fails to resolve is a portable file: the
 * measurement behind the record was soft-deleted, so the file omits it while
 * the record still names it.
 *
 * ## An unlocked badge is not judged against the catalogue
 *
 * `UserAchievement.achievementId` names a definition in
 * `src/lib/gamification/achievements.ts`. That is code, not a table, so nothing in
 * the database constrains it and an unknown value costs no error. It is
 * carried and written back verbatim, and the restore does not check it against
 * the catalogue this build ships. The catalogue is the part that drifts: a
 * file can be older than the release reading it, or newer. A row is evidence
 * that a person earned something on a day, and a build that no longer defines
 * the badge is not evidence that they did not. The same decision the
 * vaccination restore makes for an antigen slug it cannot resolve, for the
 * same reason.
 *
 * ## One wire shape, both purposes
 *
 * Neither model has a tombstone column and neither holds ciphertext, so a
 * portable export and a disaster-recovery payload carry byte-identical
 * sections. This builder therefore takes no `purpose`: a parameter that
 * changes nothing would advertise a distinction the file does not have.
