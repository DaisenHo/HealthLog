/**
 * The intraday shape of a cumulative day — both ends in one file.
 *
 * `IntradayCumulativeProfile` arrived in v1.34.0 classified `BACKED_UP` with a
 * sound reason and carried by nothing, which is the exact shape of defect
 * `backup-plan.ts` exists to make visible. The reason still holds: the nightly
 * drain folds the per-sample rows into these twenty-four running totals and
 * hard-deletes the originals in the same transaction, so past the 36-hour grace
 * window this table is the ONLY copy of a day's curve. A restore without it
 * rebuilds the account with every historical shape gone and reports success,
 * and the same-time baseline silently reads "still learning" for a fortnight
 * while it re-accumulates days it already had.
 *
 * The builder and the restore live together deliberately, the way
 * `profile-backup.ts` and `src/lib/cycle/backup.ts` do: a reader asking "is
 * this carried at both ends?" answers it in one file, and a reader who greps
 * only the restore ROUTE gets a false negative, because the route delegates.
 *
 * Nothing here is encrypted, so there is no portable/DR split on the values.
 * The only difference between the two purposes is identity: a canonical
 * disaster-recovery payload carries the row id and its timestamps so the row
 * comes back as itself, a portable export carries the shape alone.
