/**
 * The Vorsorge reminders and their completion ledger, with both backup ends
 * in one file.
 *
 * Same arrangement as `visits-backup.ts` and `vaccinations-backup.ts`, for
 * the same reason: a reader asking "is this carried at both ends?" answers it
 * here, and a reader who greps only the restore ROUTE gets a false negative
 * because the route delegates.
 *
 * Two models ride: the reminder and the ledger row behind it
 * (v1.37.20, #223 / iOS #68). Both are carried rather than owed. The
 * reminder spent its time on the coverage-pending register — "a restore
 * leaves the account silent until each one is set up again" — and the ledger
 * raised the cost of that debt the release it landed: the engine is
 * single-cursor, so the ledger is the ONLY copy of every satisfy and skip
 * before the latest one. A restore without this section hands back a silent
 * account with no history of it ever having been diligent.
 *
 * Each model uses its own named select constant and its own delegate call.
 * `events` is a relation field name here and nowhere else today, but the
 * delegate-per-model shape is kept anyway — `documentLinks` taught this
 * directory what a shared relation name does to a structural matcher.
 *
 * One reference needs care on the way back: `MeasurementReminderEvent.reminderId`
 * addresses a reminder in this same section. The builder filters the ledger to
 * the reminders it actually carries — a portable export omits tombstoned
 * reminders, and a ledger row whose reminder is not in the file could never
 * restore — so a file this release writes always resolves completely. A
 * hand-edited or truncated file that does not is reported, never guessed at.
