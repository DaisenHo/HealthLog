/**
 * The structured-records section: labs, illness history, allergies, family
 * history, workout summaries and the document vault, with the manifest that
 * discloses what each of them leaves out.
 *
 * Each record kind is a domain of its own, with its export and its restore in
 * one module (`labs-backup.ts`, `illness-backup.ts`, `allergies-backup.ts`,
 * `family-history-backup.ts`, `workouts-backup.ts`, `documents-backup.ts`).
 * This file lays their slices out in the order the file has always had.
 *
 * Portable exports keep the historical v1.28 metadata-only document shape.
 * The weekly disaster-recovery writer opts into the canonical mode, which
 * carries the encrypted document bytes and their persistence metadata
 * verbatim. The DR path never decrypts document content or summaries.
 *
 * Every read is scoped to the owner. Soft-deleted rows are excluded so a
 * restore cannot resurrect tombstones. Other encrypted free-text fields are
 * carried as plaintext and re-encrypted by the restore importer; one this
 * instance cannot decrypt is carried as a visible marker rather than as
 * nothing.
