/**
 * v1.11.0 — clinician share-link lifecycle validation (Epic C, C4).
 *
 * The OWNER creates a time-boxed, scope-frozen share link to their own health
 * record. On create the server mints an `hls_<48 hex>` token (192-bit), stores
 * ONLY its HMAC hash, and returns the raw token exactly once. Every scope
 * column (window, sections) is write-once at creation — there is no
 * widen/update path. `expiresAt` is REQUIRED and capped at
 * `SHARE_LINK_MAX_DAYS` so no link ever lives forever.
 *
 * The `resourceTypes` / `allowFhirApi` request keys are gone. They configured
 * a scoped FHIR face for a share link that was never built, and accepting a
 * scope for a face that does not exist only made the promise look kept. An
 * unknown key is rejected by `.strict()`, so a caller still sending them gets
 * a 422 that names them rather than a silent no-op. The link's record IS
 * reachable in machine form now — as a download at `/c/{token}/fhir`, behind
 * the same unlock the page uses, serving exactly the frozen selection.
 *
 * Strict: `.strict()` rejects unknown keys; there is intentionally no `userId`
 * field (the owner is always narrowed from `requireAuth()`).
