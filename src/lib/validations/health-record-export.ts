/**
 * The health-record / doctor-handover export selection.
 *
 * One strict Zod schema driving `POST /api/export/health-record`. `.strict()`
 * rejects unknown keys, and there is intentionally NO `userId` field — the
 * user is always narrowed from `requireAuth()`, never accepted from the body.
 *
 * `selection` is REQUIRED and is the leaf inclusion list. The grouped
 * `sections` shape it replaces resolved an absent key to "included", so a
 * caller who sent nothing received roughly fifty metrics plus the medication
 * list, labs, allergies and family history — a scope nobody chose. Sending
 * `sections` now 422s with the key named rather than being folded into a
 * default, because silently accepting the old shape would mean silently
 * choosing a scope the caller did not express.
 *
 * The AI summary is gone with it. Its text was pulled from the cached
 * briefing with no relation to the selection at all, so its scope could not be
 * proven — and prose whose scope cannot be proven cannot ride a document whose
 * whole point is a proven scope.
