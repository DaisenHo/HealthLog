/**
 * v1.4.40 SB-10 — AI consent receipts (App-Store Guideline 5.1.2(i) +
 * GDPR Art. 7 audit trail).
 *
 * The discriminator covers the consent surfaces collected independently:
 *   - `ai_full`           full assistant + on-device personalisation
 *   - `ai_insights_only`  read-only Insights generation (no Coach)
 *   - `ai_coach`          chat-style Coach access
 *   - `ai_extraction`     reading documents, lab report scans and typed
 *                         medication text with an external model (minted by
 *                         the document auto-read toggle; it satisfies neither
 *                         the Coach nor the analysis)
 *
 * Keeping each surface as its own row means the legal team can prove
 * which exact scope the user agreed to without parsing the signed
 * artefact server-side. The server stays opaque to the artefact's
 * format — we accept either a base64-encoded PDF or a signed JWT, the
 * audit trail *is* the storage plus the `signedAt` timestamp.

 *
