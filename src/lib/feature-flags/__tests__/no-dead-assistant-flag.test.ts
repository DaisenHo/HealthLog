/**
 * Every assistant switch an operator can flip has to move something, a
 * switch that was retired stays retired, and the retired gate stays gone.
 *
 * `healthScoreExplainer` did not move anything. It gated a caption beside the
 * Health-Score delta; the caption's component went when the health score was
 * replaced by the reference composite, and the toggle stayed on the admin
 * panel, in the flag matrix and in the API contract for two releases, so an
 * operator could turn it off, be told it saved, and change nothing at all.
 * `correlations` was the same shape one level down: it gated statistics, which
 * no model writes, so turning it off removed a computation and stopped no AI
 * work. A switch that lies is worse than no switch.
 *
 * Four guards:
 *
 *   1. The retired switches stay removed, in every place they lived.
 *   2. No sub-switch exists without a capability it covers, and none without a
 *      surface that reads it. Plumbing does not count: the admin panel, the
 *      loader, the hook and the two switch routes carry every switch by
 *      construction, so a dead one would look alive if they could vouch for
 *      it. A switch whose reader lands with the routes it covers is named in
 *      `AWAITING_READER` with the reason, and the entry fails the moment a
 *      reader appears, so it cannot outlive its reason.
 *   3. `requireAssistantSurface` and `AssistantDisabledError` are gone. They
 *      answered only the operator layer; `requireAiCapability` answers every
 *      layer with the same `assistant.disabled.<switch>` code for the operator
 *      case. Nothing may define or call them again.
 *   4. The matchers find what they are meant to judge (non-zero counts), so a
 *      matcher that stopped matching cannot agree with an empty world.
 *
 * Mutation checks: adding `await requireAssistantSurface("coach")` to any
 * route turns guard 3 red by file name; deleting the
 * `requireAiCapability("documentAi"` calls from the document routes (the only
 * reader of that switch's capabilities in the route tree) turns guard 2 red;
 * putting `assistantCorrelationsEnabled` back on the schema turns guard 1 red.
