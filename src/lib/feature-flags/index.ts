 * set leaves this module, so no reader composes `master && sub`.
 *
 * What a switch decides is AI work and AI text, never data. Whether a given
 * capability is available for a given record is the resolver's answer, which
 * also weighs modules, provider-work authority, provider presence and consent;
 * a route that serves or calls a model asks the resolver, not this file.
