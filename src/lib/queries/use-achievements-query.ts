/**
 * v1.4.34 — single TanStack-Query wrapper for
 * `/api/gamification/achievements`.
 *
 * Pre-fix, three consumers each declared their own `useQuery` block:
 *   - `<RecentAchievementsCard>` with `["gamification", "achievements"]`,
 *   - the `/achievements` mother page with the same literal key, and
 *   - `<AchievementUnlockNotifier>` with a different key
 *     (`["gamification", "achievements", "unlock-notifier", userId]`)
 *     plus a 2-minute refetch interval.
 *
 * TanStack treats the divergent key as a fresh cache cell, so the
 * dashboard fired two network calls instead of one on every cold
 * mount — once for the card, once for the notifier. The
 * `round-v1434-prod-slowness-investigation.md` HAR catches the
 * duplicate landing inside the same ~3 s pool-starvation tail.
 *
 * This hook mirrors the v1.4.33 `use-analytics-query.ts` shape:
 *   - centralises the queryKey via `queryKeys.gamificationAchievements()`,
 *   - sets `staleTime: 60_000` so a route swing within a minute is a
 *     free cache hit,
 *   - keeps `refetchOnMount: false` + `refetchOnWindowFocus: false` so
 *     route transitions never trigger a refetch storm,
 *   - defaults to `enabled: isAuthenticated` so the unauthenticated
 *     surfaces don't spin up a 401-bound request,
 *   - lets the notifier opt into the 2-minute `refetchInterval` so its
 *     "fresh unlock" toast still fires for users who keep the tab open
 *     without forcing the card to refetch on the same cadence — the
 *     cache slot is shared, so a single refetch updates both.
