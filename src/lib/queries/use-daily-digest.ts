/**
 * Client cell for the unified daily digest (`GET /api/daily/digest`).
 *
 * The Today hero reads the ALREADY-CACHED `DailyDigest` DTO S1 assembled
 * server-side. This hook is a plain GET of that cached route — it never
 * warms a provider, never triggers a fresh AI call (the whole daily-value
 * system's warm-on-mount ban extends here); the route composes from the
 * nightly-cached briefing + dashboard snapshot ingredients.
 *
 * Gating: `enabled` is caller-supplied so the page can fold in the
 * `insights` module flag (the digest is the AI-narrative daily layer;
 * the route returns 403 `module.disabled` when insights is off) and the
 * auth state. Freshness mirrors the dashboard snapshot cadence — a warm
 * return-to-dashboard within the `staleTime` is a free cache hit, and a
 * background sync surfaces on focus/poll — so the two above-the-fold
 * cells refresh in lockstep without a second request storm.
 *
 * The read unwraps the `{ data, error }` envelope through `apiGet`
 * (`(await res.json()).data`), and the queryKey is the centralised
 * factory entry `queryKeys.dailyDigest()`.
