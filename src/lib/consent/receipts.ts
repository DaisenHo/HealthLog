 * no updates, no deletes outside of cascade-on-user-delete. A
 * revocation (`withdrawConsent` in `./withdrawal`) writes the current
 * row's `revokedAt` — that single field flip is the only mutation a
 * receipt ever sees. A subsequent re-grant inserts a new row, so the
 * historical chain stays intact for legal review.
 *
 * Source of truth for "is AI active right now?" is
 * `latestActiveReceipt(userId, kind)` returning non-null. Reader
 * routes never inspect older rows.
