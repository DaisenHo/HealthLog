/**
 * The resolved report selection: an inclusion list of leaf ids, and the only
 * three ways to mint one.
 *
 * Membership is inclusion. Absence is exclusion. There is no defaults constant
 * anywhere in this module, because a default that means "yes" is the defect
 * this shape exists to remove: the flat preferences object it replaces
 * resolved an absent key to "included", so a caller who sent nothing received
 * the whole record.
 *
 * The brand means a call site cannot hand `collectDoctorReportData` an object
 * literal. It has to go through one of the three minting functions below, and
 * those are the only place the version policy and the unknown-id policy live.
