/**
 * The read every surface that decides which workout is canonical goes through.
 *
 * `pickCanonicalWorkoutRows` clusters workouts of one sport by start time,
 * anchored on each cluster's first start (see `workoutDuplicateClusterKeys`).
 * That makes the cluster of a workout depend on the workouts around it: on
 * the twin a few minutes after it, which may lie past the end of the range a
 * surface asked for, and on the run of workouts before it, which decides where
 * the anchors fall. A surface that handed the picker only the rows inside its
 * own range got an answer that depended on the range: the list and the detail
 * of one workout disagreed about which row was canonical, and 09:58, 10:02 and
 * 10:06 were grouped one way by a read starting at 09:55 and another way by a
 * read starting at 10:00.
 *
 * `readWorkoutsAroundRange` reads the range plus one duplicate window after its
 * end, and before its start as far as it takes to reach, for every sport with a
 * row in the range, a workout that starts a full window after the one before
 * it. Such a workout is an anchor whatever comes before it, so from there on
 * the clusters are the ones a read of the whole history would produce. The
 * surfaces then pick over everything read and keep the rows that start inside
 * their range: a workout is canonical, or not, the same way on every surface.
 *
 * A read callback may still carry a row cap as a runaway guard. A capped read
 * that actually hits its cap has lost rows at one end and is outside this
 * guarantee; the caps sit far above any real account's volume.
