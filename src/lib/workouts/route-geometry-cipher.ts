/**
 * Workout GPS track ↔ encrypted column (v1.39.4).
 *
 * `WorkoutRoute.geometry` held the GeoJSON LineString of every outdoor workout
 * readable in the database, and the first and last points of most tracks are
 * the person's front door. From v1.39.4 the track is stored in
 * `geometryEncrypted`: the JSON text sealed as one binary AES-256-GCM value
 * (`encryptBytes`, labelled with {@link WORKOUT_ROUTE_GEOMETRY_AAD}). The
 * binary codec rather than the base64 string codec the notes use, because a
 * track of 20 000 points is a blob and base64 would add a third to it.
 *
 * Every reader goes through {@link readRouteGeometry}: the ciphertext when a
 * row has one, the legacy readable column for a row the boot-time backfill has
 * not reached yet. A ciphertext that does not open reads as no track, with a
 * warning on the request's event: it is never replaced by the readable column,
 * and one damaged track must not fail the workout detail or the insight job
 * that reads it. `decryptRouteGeometry` itself still throws.
 *
 * The wire shape is unchanged: readers hand back the same GeoJSON object the
 * JSONB column used to return.
