/**
 * The deterministic evidence block behind the per-workout Activity Insight.
 *
 * Everything the model is ever told about a session is built here, and the
 * shape of this module is the security boundary of the whole feature: it is a
 * NUMBERS-ONLY projection over closed fields.
 *
 * What is excluded, and why each one matters:
 *
 *   - `metadata` — a JSON blob of device bundle ids, HKWorkoutEvent markers and
 *     per-vendor extras. Never passed in at all; the only thing taken from it
 *     anywhere on this path is the numeric WHOOP zone-duration array, and that
 *     goes through `parseWhoopZoneDurations` before it gets near here.
 *   - `externalId` — a vendor-supplied opaque string. Never selected.
 *   - route geometry — consumed to derive ONE number (metres climbed) and then
 *     dropped. It is location history, not a figure, and it may not ride a
 *     prompt.
 *   - `sportType` — a TEXT column. The API write path constrains it to
 *     `workoutSportTypeEnum`, but the BACKUP RESTORE path accepts
 *     `z.string().min(1)`, so a restored row can carry arbitrary
 *     attacker-chosen text. It is therefore re-asserted against the enum HERE,
 *     at projection time, and anything unrecognised folds to `"other"`. The
 *     enum is imported from the schema module rather than copied, because a
 *     hand-copied vocabulary drifts.
 *
 * And the claim is enforced by `assertNumericLeaves`, not by this comment: the
 * projection is walked before it is returned and ANY non-numeric leaf at any
 * depth throws. A future field that quietly admits a string fails loudly at the
 * seam instead of arriving in a prompt.
 *
 * Determinism is the second contract. The same session always projects to the
 * same numbers, which is what makes the input hash a real no-op gate: a WHOOP
 * re-sync or an iOS `stats:` overwrite that changes nothing the paragraph
 * narrates hashes identically and never reaches a provider.
