/**
 * The latest canonical reading per measurement type: the latest UTC day
 * first, then the source ladder (the canonical source wins), then the latest
 * reading of that source, so a tile's headline matches its chart. `since`
 * drops a type whose latest reading is older than it.
 *
 * Driven from the type list rather than a `DISTINCT ON (type)` over the
 * account: Postgres 16 has no skip scan, so that shape sorted every live row
 * of the account to keep one per type. Here each type costs one probe of
 * `measurements_live_covering_idx` for its latest instant and one read of that
 * single day. The closed day window matters to the planner as much as to the
 * result: with only the lower bound it estimates a third of the type's rows
 * per probe, and the summed estimate crosses `jit_above_cost`, whose
 * compilation then costs more than the query itself.
