/**
 * The day-grouped list for a cumulative type, paged over local days.
 *
 * Everything heavy runs in Postgres. The first query picks the page: the
 * distinct local days that hold a reading, sorted and cut by `limit` /
 * `offset`, each row carrying the distinct-day count of the whole filtered
 * set as `meta.total` from a window count. The second folds only the page's
 * days, one row per day, source, device and unit with its sum and sample
 * count, and the source ladder picks among those groups exactly as it would
 * among the raw rows (it keeps or drops whole source and device groups per
 * day, never single rows). So a page costs its own days whatever the length
 * of the history, every day is complete, and no raw row reaches the heap.
 *
 * Until v1.43.6 the branch read the newest `limit` raw rows (the web asked
 * for 5000), bucketed them and returned every bucket. A long history came
 * back as thousands of rows in one response, and every day older than the
 * 5000th raw row was missing with nothing to say so.
 *
 * A day exists for the page when any reading of the type falls on it; the
 * source collapse narrows a day's groups but never empties one, so the count
 * and the folded rows agree. A value range would filter single readings and
 * leave partial days behind, so the validator refuses `valueMin` /
 * `valueMax` beside `groupBy=day`.
 *
 * Every page reads the filtered history to find its days. After the nightly
 * drain a cumulative type holds about one row per day and source, so the
 * scan is the index-only walk over days it would be anyway.
