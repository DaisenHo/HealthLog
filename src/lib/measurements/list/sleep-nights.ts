 * earlier row has ended. A session's night is the local day its last row
 * ends on: the reconstruction's own rule, so a page night and a
 * reconstructed night name the same day. A night counts when one of its
 * sessions holds an asleep row (an `ASLEEP_STAGES` stage, or a stage-less
 * row, with minutes). Nights are grouped, sorted and cut by `limit` /
 * `offset`; `total` counts the whole filtered set. `spanStart` / `spanEnd`
 * bound every session of the night, the in-bed-only ones included, because
 * the reconstruction adds their in-bed time to the night: a span over the
 * asleep sessions alone left an evening's in-bed block out of a chunked read
 * that the one-night read, reaching a day and a half, counted.
 *
 * Before the cut, rows are folded into hour buckets by their end: min start,
 * max end, any asleep. That cannot move a session boundary. Two rows whose
 * ends lie less than the session gap apart always share a session (the later
 * one starts before its own end, which is within the gap of the earlier end),
 * so a bucket narrower than the gap only ever holds rows of one session, and
 * its bounds are that group's bounds. It cuts the rows the window functions
 * sort from every stage to a handful per night.
