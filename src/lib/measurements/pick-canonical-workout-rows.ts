/**
 * v1.4.30 — cross-source canonical-row picker for `Workout` rows.
 *
 * Same intent as `pickCanonicalSourceRows()` in
 * `src/lib/analytics/source-priority.ts`, applied to workouts. A user
 * wearing an Apple Watch + a Withings ScanWatch records the same run
 * once via each integration; the dashboard "Recent workouts" tile
 * would otherwise show the run twice.
 *
 * Algorithm (v1.4.30 — matches the measurement ladder per R-F open
 * question #4):
 *   1. Bucket workouts by the rounded start timestamp + sport-type
 *      (`<5-minute slot>:<sport>`). Two HKWorkout entries for the same
 *      logical run start within a minute of each other on both
 *      sources; the rounding gives the cross-source matcher slack
 *      without collapsing distinct back-to-back workouts.
 *   2. For each bucket, walk the source ladder (`workoutSourceLadder`)
 *      and pick the FIRST source that has any row in that bucket. Keep
 *      every row from the winning source; drop the rest.
 *   3. Rows whose source isn't in the ladder pass through untouched
 *      (fallback intent — never silently drop signal).
 *
 * Determinism precondition: input rows MUST be in deterministic order
 * (typically `ORDER BY startedAt ASC, id ASC` from the caller's
 * Prisma read). The output preserves input order.
 *
 * This is the one workout picker. The reads use it, and so does the batch
 * write route before it inserts: a write-time picker with its own window
 * and a different default ladder kept or dropped a different row than the
 * list then showed.

 * HealthKit can resend the same session with a new external UUID. The source
 * ladder correctly chooses Apple over WHOOP, but previously kept every Apple
 * row in that winning bucket, which made the web list show the same workout
 * two or three times.
 *
 * The identity is `(sportType, startedAt, durationSec)`. `endedAt` was part of
 * this key when the collapse first shipped and has been dropped deliberately:
 *
 *   - It is not a free extra check. On a workout with pauses, `endedAt` is the
 *     wall-clock end while `durationSec` counts only moving time, so the two
 *     legitimately disagree, and a stored row can carry either convention. Two
 *     re-sends of one session can therefore differ in `endedAt` alone, and the
 *     stricter key let that duplicate through.
 *   - It bought nothing in exchange. Nobody starts a second workout of the
 *     same sport in the same instant with the same duration, so start plus
 *     duration already identifies the session uniquely.
 *   - Requiring it split the callers. Four of the five call sites select
 *     `durationSec` but not `endedAt`, so the collapse ran on the workout list
 *     and silently did nothing for the Coach narration, the per-sport baseline
 *     and the deep-link cluster. One list, one number, two answers.
 *
 * A row without `durationSec` cannot be identified and passes through
 * uncollapsed. That is a fixture-only path: every production call site selects
 * the field and `workout-canonical-identity-guard.test.ts` keeps it that way.
