/**
 * The ingest-side half of the app's plausibility domain.
 *
 * `VALUE_RANGES` in `@/lib/measurements/value-ranges` is the band the
 * application declares a metric can occupy — PULSE 20–300, WEIGHT 1–500,
 * SLEEP_DURATION 0–1440 minutes. Every path a person can drive enforces it:
 * the measurement routes, the batch endpoint, the CSV and Apple-export
 * importers, MCP, Telegram. The provider sync writers did not. They took the
 * number the remote handed over and wrote it, so a decode slip or a glitched
 * device landed a row the application itself calls impossible, and every mean,
 * median and personal band downstream digested it as a reading.
 *
 * `isPlausibleMetricValue` (in `value-domain.ts`) already answers the question
 * for the READ side, which is where the damage surfaced first. This module is
 * the same question asked one layer earlier, at the point of writing, so the
 * row never lands. The two ends share the one predicate on purpose: a band the
 * reader hides but the writer accepts is a row that exists and cannot be seen,
 * which is the worse of the two failures.
 *
 * ## Disposition: drop, and say so
 *
 * An out-of-band incoming value is DROPPED. Not clamped (a clamp invents a
 * reading nobody took), not stored-and-flagged (a quarantined row is still a
 * row, and every consumer would need to learn the flag), not fatal to the
 * batch (one glitched sample must not strand the sync's other readings behind
 * a held watermark). Absence reads as absence: the sample is simply not part
 * of the record.
 *
 * A silent drop, though, is indistinguishable from a provider that sent
 * nothing — so every drop is tallied onto the ambient wide event under
 * {@link RANGE_REJECTED_META_KEY}, with the metric type, the provider, and the
 * direction it broke the band in. Counts only. The value itself is a health
 * reading and never enters the log line; the direction plus the metric's own
 * declared bound is what a diagnosis actually needs.
 *
 * ## Why meta and not `action`
 *
 * A wide event holds exactly ONE action, and `setAction` replaces it. A drop
 * happens in the middle of a sync whose action is decided at the end, so an
 * `action` set here is either clobbered a moment later (the drop vanishes) or,
 * on the paths that annotate no terminal action, relabels an otherwise
 * successful sync as a rejection. Meta accumulates, survives every later
 * `setAction`, and is the shape a dashboard can sum. One warning per provider
 * per event rides along so the drop also lifts the event's level to `warn`
 * rather than hiding inside a green line.
