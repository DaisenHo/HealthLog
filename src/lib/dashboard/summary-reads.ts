/**
 * The two per-type reads behind the dashboard summary's metric tiles.
 *
 * Both used to live inline in `src/app/api/dashboard/summary/route.ts`.
 * They are lifted out for the same reason `buildMedsTodayBlock` is: the
 * SQL is the contract, and a contract that only exists inside a route
 * handler cannot be exercised against a real Postgres. The integration
 * suite runs THESE functions, not a transcription of them.
 *
 * Both reads are shaped by one property of the schema: PostgreSQL 16 has
 * no index skip scan. An index on `(user_id, type, …)` cannot hand back
 * "one row per type" on its own — something has to supply the type list.
 * So both queries name it. `measurementTypes` is the complete canonical
 * enum, so naming it filters nothing out; it exists to give the planner
 * an equality on the leading type column, which turns a full pass over
 * the account into one bounded lookup per type.

/**
 * Latest live reading per measurement type.
 *
 * v1.38.5 — a LATERAL join over the type list, replacing the
 * `DISTINCT ON (m."type")` this read used to be.
 *
 * The DISTINCT-ON shape has to produce every live row of the account in
 * `(type, measured_at DESC)` order before it can throw all but the first
 * of each group away. With no skip scan there is no index that hands it
 * one row per type, so on a multi-year account it degrades to a
 * sequential scan plus an in-memory sort that spills to disk once it
 * outgrows `work_mem`.
 *
 * Driving the read from the type list instead makes it one index lookup
 * per type against `measurements_live_covering_idx` (the partial
 * `(user_id, type, measured_at DESC) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL` index from
 * migration 0183), each stopping at the first row. `CROSS JOIN LATERAL`
 * is an inner join, so a type with no live reading drops out exactly as
 * DISTINCT ON dropped it, and `ORDER BY mt."type"` reproduces the enum
 * ordering the old `ORDER BY m."type"` emitted. Same rows, same order.
 *
 * The driving relation is aliased `mt`, not `t`: a one-letter `t` alias
 * makes `t("type")` in the SQL text look exactly like a `t()` translation
 * call to the i18n call-site scanner, which then reports a missing key.

 * keeps the returned row set provably identical to the unfiltered read,
