/**
 * The snapshot read and the snapshot invalidator must agree on one key.
 *
 * `dashboardSnapshotCacheKey` is the declared source of truth, and the
 * invalidators sweep by its prefix. The read used to spell the same string
 * out by hand: identical today, silently divergent the moment either side is
 * edited, and the failure is invisible — the dashboard just keeps painting
 * the pre-write body until the entry ages out.
 *
 * So this asserts the agreement by effect rather than by text: warm the cell
 * through the real read, invalidate through the real invalidator, and require
 * that the next read rebuilds.
