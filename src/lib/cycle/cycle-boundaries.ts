/**
 * Cycle boundary re-derivation — the inverse of what a period-start write does
 * to its neighbours.
 *
 * `POST /api/cycle/period` with `action:"start"` is not an insert. It closes
 * the previous open cycle (stamps `endDate` and `lengthDays` from the new
 * start) and, when the start is back-filled between two existing cycles, takes
 * the inserted cycle's own end from its successor. Removing that start left
 * every one of those overwrites standing: the previous cycle kept the end date
 * a cycle that no longer exists gave it, and a record whose last cycle is
 * closed has no open cycle for the engine to forecast from. The prediction
 * disappeared and there was no way to bring it back from the app.
 *
 * The repair is a re-derivation rather than an undo log, which is why it is
 * safe to run on a record whose history came from an import or a restore
 * instead of from the one-tap boundary: a cycle ends the day before the next
 * one begins, and when there is no next one it is open. That statement is true
 * of every cycle in the table regardless of how the row got there, so applying
 * it to the surviving neighbour restores exactly the state the start write
 * moved — and applying it twice changes nothing the second time.

 * Whether a logged day's bleeding is the first day of a period, and therefore

 *
 * Cycle rows used to come only from the one-tap period boundary. Every other
 * way of recording bleeding — the log sheet's flow chips, the bulk drain, an
 * Apple Health export of menstrual-flow samples — wrote a day-log and stopped
 * there, and the engine reads cycle rows. A person could log every period they
 * had and the module would still hold that none had happened.
 *
 * The rule is deliberately conservative, because a false cycle start corrupts
 * every length the engine derives afterwards:
 *
 *   - SPOTTING does not open a cycle. It is as often the tail of a period or
 *     its herald as its first day, and the user has an explicit chip for a
 *     real flow when it is one.
 *   - Bleeding flagged as between periods does not open a cycle. That flag
 *     exists to say exactly this.
 *   - A bleeding day within the hard physiological minimum cycle length of an
 *     existing cycle's start is part of that cycle, not a new one. This is
 *     what keeps day three of a period — or a day two somebody forgot and
 *     entered later — from starting a cycle of its own, and it needs no
 *     contiguity check to do it.
 *
 * The cost is that a genuinely short cycle (under the hard minimum) is not
 * inferred from flow alone. The one-tap start still opens one on any date, so
 * the case has an answer; guessing it from flow does not.
