/**
 * v1.4.25 W19e — pure compliance chip aggregator.
 *
 * Reuses `buildCadenceTimeline` to count taken vs missed slots over a
 * rolling window. The W19e detail page surfaces four chips: adherence
 * rate, current streak (days), longest streak (days), missed in last
 * 30 days. Each chip is monochrome — maintainer note: no gamified badges.
 *
 * Adherence and missed doses come from the compliance ledger the
 * /api/medications/[id]/compliance route reads, so the chips and the
 * detail page's rate agree; the streaks walk the pair-matched timeline
 * the cadence chart draws.
 *
 * The timeline and streak math run in the context's IANA zone, so a user
 * in Tokyo gets the same chip values as a user in Berlin whatever the
 * host's system time is.
