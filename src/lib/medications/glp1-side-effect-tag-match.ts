/**
 * The GLP-1 side-effect tag catalogue — server-only matching half.
 *
 * Turns a stored flat mood tag back into the catalogue key it was written
 * from, in any locale the app ships.
 *
 * The index is DERIVED from `messages/<locale>.json`, not transcribed from it.
 * That is the load-bearing part. The three readers this replaces each carried
 * their own hand-written word list, covering English and German because those
 * were the two languages the maintainer typed in; the four other shipped
 * locales silently matched nothing, and the three lists had already drifted
 * apart from each other. A transcription would fix today's four locales and
 * reopen the same hole the day a seventh is added. Reading the bundles means a
 * new locale needs no edit in this file — `locales` grows, `messages/xx.json`
 * lands, and the labels that ship in it are matchable the same day.
 *
 * `allMessages` statically imports all six bundles and is SERVER-ONLY: do not
 * import this module from a client component. The three callers (the timeline
 * route, the Coach snapshot builder, the doctor-report aggregator) all run on
 * the server. A browser that needs to render a key resolves it through
 * `GLP1_SIDE_EFFECT_TAG_LABEL_KEYS` in the isomorphic half instead.
 *
 * Known limit, stated rather than engineered around: the index is built from
 * the labels a bundle carries TODAY, and it is applied to tags written in the
 * past. Editing a shipped translation therefore orphans the rows written under
 * the old wording. If a label has to change, keep the old string reachable —
 * the fix is a legacy alias here, not a data migration.
