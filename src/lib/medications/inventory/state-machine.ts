/**
 * v1.4.25 — container inventory state machine.
 *
 * Pure functions over a minimal `InventoryItemView` shape — no DB
 * access, no Prisma imports. The route handlers, the consumption hook
 * (`./consumption.ts`), and the daily expire cron all compose this
 * module with their own persistence layer.
 *
 * Decision tree (in evaluation order):
 *   1. unitsRemaining === 0           → USED_UP   (terminal)
 *   2. printedExpiry  && now > expiry → EXPIRED   (printed label trumps clock)
 *   3. firstUseAt && the container carries a post-opening clock &&
 *      now > firstUseAt + IN_USE_WINDOW_MS               → EXPIRED
 *   4. firstUseAt is set              → IN_USE
 *   5. otherwise                      → ACTIVE
 *
 * v1.16.10 — the item counts UNITS (tablets / ampoules / puffs), not
 * doses; `Medication.unitsPerDose` maps between the two. The state
 * machine is unit-agnostic — it only cares whether the count reached
 * zero.
 *
 * ## Which containers carry a post-opening clock
 *
 * Clause 3 exists because breaching a sealed multi-dose reservoir
 * exposes its contents: an injection pen's septum is punctured on the
 * first dose and the product information caps how long the remainder
 * stays usable (EMA EPAR §6.3). That fact is a property of the
 * CONTAINER, not of every supply row, and applying it blindly wrote off
 * good stock: pressing the first tablet out of a blister started a
 * 30-day clock and a month later the untouched remainder was EXPIRED.
 *
 * So the clock now keys off `containerType`
 * ({@link IN_USE_CLOCK_CONTAINER_TYPES}):
 *
 *   - PEN — one sealed multi-dose reservoir, punctured on first use.
 *     The clock is the reason clause 3 exists.
 *   - AMPOULE — the member a punctured injectable reservoir (ampoule or
 *     multi-dose vial) lands on; there is no separate VIAL member. Same
 *     physical fact as the pen: the barrier is broken and the contents
 *     are exposed. The enum cannot tell that reservoir apart from a
 *     carton of single-use glass ampoules, where the clock would be
 *     wrong for the same reason it was wrong on a blister; the kind is
 *     never auto-selected, so choosing it is a deliberate statement
 *     about a container that was opened, and the opening date is
 *     editable when it turns out not to be.
 *   - BLISTER — every tablet sits in its own sealed foil cavity.
 *     Pressing out tablet 1 does nothing to tablets 2..n. The carton
 *     expiry is the only expiry.
 *   - INHALER — a pressurised canister has no in-use limit at all, and
 *     the dry-powder devices that do state months, not 30 days. Any
 *     fixed default here would be a fabricated number.
 *   - BOTTLE — a bottle of tablets has no in-use limit. A bottle of
 *     suspension or drops does, but it is product-specific and the enum
 *     cannot tell the two apart.
 *   - OTHER — the backfill default for every row that never chose a
 *     kind. Nothing about it says a limit exists, so none is invented.
 *
 * For every clock-less kind the printed expiry (clause 2) still applies
 * in full — an unknown container is not an unbounded one. What it does
 * not get is a deadline nobody entered, because writing stock off on a
 * guess hides supply the user physically holds and mutes the low-stock
 * signal that would have told them to reorder.
 *
 * ## Window length
 *
 * The window is fixed at 30 days per EMA EPAR §6.3 for Mounjaro
 * KwikPen / Saxenda. The per-product window is NOT read from the
 * drug-knowledge layer (`glp1-knowledge.ts`) even though it carries one
 * (`inUse.maxDays`: 14 for Trulicity, 56 for Ozempic): the only bridge
 * from an inventory row to a `Glp1DrugId` is a fuzzy match on the
 * free-text `Medication.name` (`findDrugIdByBrand`), and a mismatch
 * there would shorten a window and write stock off — the exact failure
 * this module just removed. The state machine stays window-agnostic:
 * it accepts the window length as input, so a caller that can name the
 * product with certainty can pass its own.
