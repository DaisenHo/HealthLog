/**
 * v1.22 — closed medication-class → target-vital map.
 *
 * The adherence→symptom storyline needs to know which VITAL a medication is
 * meant to move, so the Coach can say "the vital this drug targets drifted",
 * not just "an outcome moved". Today the only drug-class knowledge in the tree
 * is the GLP-1 catalog (`glp1-knowledge.ts`); this generalises that, minimally
 * and conservatively, into a hand-curated class→`MeasurementType[]` table.
 *
 * Design rules (all safety-relevant):
 *  - The table is CLOSED. A medication whose class we cannot confidently infer
 *    maps to `null` — and a null class yields NO storyline. We never guess a
 *    target; a wrong target is a wrong medication claim.
 *  - Only classes with a first-class `MeasurementType` target are listed. Statin
 *    (LDL) and thyroid (TSH) act on LAB analytes that live in `LabResult`, not
 *    the measurement series the storyline reads, so they are deliberately
 *    OUT of scope for v1.22 (documented here, not silently dropped).
 *  - Class inference is whole-token, case-insensitive INN/brand matching plus
 *    the structured `treatmentClass` discriminator + the GLP-1 catalog. No
 *    fuzzy matching — a partial hit is treated as unknown.
 *  - Matching runs on a normalised INN STEM rather than on a language. See
 *    `innStem` below: `Metformin`, `Metformine`, `Metformina`, `Metforminum`
 *    are one molecule under four national conventions, and the needle list
 *    stays one entry long.
 *
 * The storyline that consumes this stays association-only and never advises a
 * dose change; that framing is enforced in the prompt + the B0 eval cases.
