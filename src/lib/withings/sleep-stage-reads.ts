/**
 * What the Withings sleep sync learned reading each night's stage timeline,
 * kept on `WithingsConnection.sleepStageReads`.
 *
 * Two facts per night, keyed by its unix span (`"<start>:<end>"`):
 *
 *   - `empty`: reads that answered without a single stage. A tracker that
 *     never stages a night (a nap, a watch without stages) used to be read
 *     again on every run for as long as the night stayed in the 30-day
 *     window. After {@link SLEEP_STAGE_MAX_EMPTY_READS} such answers it is
 *     no longer read, except by a full sync or while Withings marks it
 *     changed.
 *   - `failed`: the night's last read errored. It is read first next run.
 *   - `failures`: reads that errored. A night Withings answers with an error
 *     every time is given up after {@link SLEEP_STAGE_MAX_FAILED_READS} of
 *     them, like an unstaged one: otherwise it held the failed-first slot and
 *     failed the leg on every run for as long as it stayed in the window.
 *
 * Versioned and validated on read: anything that is not the current shape
 * reads as no record at all, which is the behaviour before the record
 * existed.
