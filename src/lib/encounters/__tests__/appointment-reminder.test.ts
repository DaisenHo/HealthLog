/**
 * The never-nag property, proven rather than asserted in prose.
 *
 * A booked visit's reminder is a one-shot: both cadence columns are NULL, which
 * the schema documents as "anchored on `anchorDate`". The claim that follows —
 * that it can fire once and never again — is a claim about the SAME function
 * the cron calls to advance a fired reminder. If that function returned an
 * instant here, the row would re-arm every tick and nag forever about an
 * appointment that already happened, and nothing else in the system would
 * notice: the row is excluded from every list a person can see.
 *
 * The module said this test existed. It did not. That is the reason it does
 * now: a comment claiming a proof is worse than no comment, because it stops
 * the next reader looking.
