/**
 * A booked visit's reminder — one row on the EXISTING engine, not a second one.
 *
 * A planned encounter mints exactly one `MeasurementReminder` with
 * `origin = ENCOUNTER`. No new queue, no new cron, no new notification event
 * type, no new preference key: the enum's own docblock states the rule, and an
 * appointment is a reminder with a date like every other reminder with a date.
 *
 * ── Why the row is shaped the way it is ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `measurementType` is NULL, which is the engine's free-text arm: there is no
 * measurement that could satisfy "you have an appointment", so it resolves only
 * on an explicit satisfy. `intervalDays` and `rrule` are both NULL, which the
 * schema documents as a one-shot anchored on `anchorDate`.
 *
 * That last part carries a consequence worth stating rather than discovering:
 * `computeReminderNextDueAt` returns NULL when there is no cadence, so a
 * one-shot's first `nextDueAt` cannot come from it and is stamped here
 * directly. The same fact is what makes the never-nag property STRUCTURAL —
 * after the cron fires the row it calls that function to advance the slot, gets
 * NULL, and the reminder can never fire again. There is no guard enforcing
 * this and there should not be one; it is a property of having no cadence.
 *
 * ── One row per visit, ever ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Rescheduling re-anchors the existing row. It never mints a second, which is
 * why `Encounter.reminderId` is a single column and not a list. Deliberately NO
 * partial unique index enforces this: the COACH one is `WHERE origin = 'COACH'`
 * so ENCOUNTER rows do not inherit it, and a similar index here would break
 * anyone who books two appointments.
 *
 * ── The practice address is read, not copied ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The practitioner's address is encrypted at rest (`locationEncrypted`), so
 * the reminder row carries no copy of it: `MeasurementReminder.location` stays
 * NULL on every ENCOUNTER row, and a re-anchor clears a copy an earlier release
 * wrote. The tick resolves the address from the visit's practitioner when it
 * builds the push ({@link appointmentReminderAddress}), which also means an
 * edit of the address reaches a nudge that is already booked.
