/**
 * Session-scoped sweep of stale sleep-segment rows.
 *
 * Wearables re-score a night after the fact (WHOOP re-scores, Withings
 * re-aggregates, Oura revises the hypnogram, Polar re-settles the stage
 * totals). Before the stable-externalId fix, a re-scored night minted FRESH
 * segment externalIds (positional indexes renumbered, boundaries shifted), so
 * the upsert inserted a second set of rows next to the first and the
 * night-total silently double-counted. The externalIds are stable now, but two
 * classes of orphans remain: rows a re-score genuinely dropped (a segment that
 * no longer exists in the fresh scoring) and every legacy row still keyed on
 * the old volatile format. This sweep clears both, so the id change self-heals
 * without a migration — the same posture as Google Health's
 * `replaceStaleGoogleHealthSleep`, expressed as an externalId-prefix bound
 * instead of a time-window bound because these integrations key every segment
 * row under a per-session externalId prefix.
 *
 * Safety contract (pinned by `__tests__/sweep-stale-segments.test.ts`):
 *   - Bounded to the sessions of THIS fetch — each entry sweeps only rows whose
 *     `externalId` starts with that one session's prefix. Never a blanket
 *     delete.
 *   - LIVE rows only (`deletedAt: null`), `SLEEP_DURATION` only, one source.
 *   - The fresh id set (`keepIds`) is never touched; an entry with no fresh ids
 *     is skipped entirely (a mapper hiccup must not wipe a night).
 *   - Soft-delete (`deletedAt = now`), never a hard remove.
 *   - Best-effort: a failed sweep warns and moves on — it never fails the
 *     user's sync. The session stays inside the integration's re-fetch window,
 *     so the next tick retries the sweep.
