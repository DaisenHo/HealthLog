/**
 * Shared OAuth rotating-refresh-token persistence helper.
 *
 * Fitbit, WHOOP, and Oura all issue ONE-TIME-USE refresh tokens: every refresh
 * response carries a fresh `refresh_token` that invalidates the one just spent.
 * The naive read → refresh → persist sequence is racy. When two syncs for the
 * same user overlap (a scheduled tick collides with a manual sync, or two
 * resource syncs each call `getValidToken`), both read the SAME stored refresh
 * token, both POST it, and the provider honours only the first. The loser's POST
 * comes back 401, the caller classifies it as `reauth_required`, and the
 * connection is parked at `error_reauth` — spuriously, because the peer already
 * rotated the token successfully and the connection is perfectly healthy.
 *
 * The fix is a compare-and-swap on persistence: write the rotated tokens with a
 * `WHERE refreshToken = <the exact ciphertext we read>` guard. The tokens are
 * AES-256-GCM encrypted with a random IV, so the guard matches the STORED
 * ciphertext (passed in verbatim), never a re-encryption of the plaintext —
 * re-encrypting the same plaintext yields different bytes. If the conditional
 * update touches zero rows a peer refresh already won; re-read the row and reuse
 * the peer's freshly-rotated access token instead of erroring.
 *
 * Both racing callers thus end up with a usable access token and neither parks
 * the connection. The window is small but real on the shared scheduler, and a
 * single spurious reauth forces the user back through the consent flow.
 */
