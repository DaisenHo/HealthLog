/**
 * Nightly cleanup of the dead rows of the sign-in ledgers.
 *
 * Every sign-in writes a session, every native sign-in and refresh writes a
 * refresh token and an access token, every second-factor prompt and passkey
 * ceremony writes a challenge, and "remember this device" writes a trusted
 * device. Nothing removed them once they expired, so the tables were mostly
 * dead rows: on a long-running instance nine in ten sessions and access
 * tokens had expired.
 *
 * What still reads a dead row decides how long it stays:
 *
 * - Sessions and refresh tokens: the login throttle recognises a source by a
 *   session or refresh token created from the same address in the last 30
 *   days (`KNOWN_ADDRESS_WINDOW_MS`), and by any refresh token of the device.
 *   Reuse detection reads a consumed refresh token until it expires (an
 *   expired one is refused before reuse is considered). So a row goes 30 days
 *   after it expired: it was created before that, so the address window
 *   cannot reach it, and a device that has not signed in for that long is a
 *   new source again. A revoked token waits for its expiry like any other.
 * - Access tokens (`api_tokens`): the token list shows revoked and expired
 *   tokens so their owner can see what ended. One goes 30 days after it
 *   expired; a revoked token without an expiry stays, since nothing records
 *   when it was revoked. Connector tokens have their own sweep
 *   (`mcp-token-cleanup`).
 * - Second-factor and passkey challenges: nothing reads one past its expiry.
 *   A day of slack keeps a ceremony in flight at midnight out of the way.
 * - Trusted devices: an expired one no longer skips the second factor and is
 *   not listed; it goes 30 days after it expired.
 *
 * Security activity is read from the audit log, never from these tables, so
 * it loses nothing. Each table is deleted in bounded batches.
