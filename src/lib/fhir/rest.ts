/**
 * v1.11.0 — shared helpers for the read-only FHIR R4 REST face.
 *
 * The `GET /api/fhir/*` search routes are thin: each resolves the caller's own
 * `DoctorReportData` (the SAME aggregator the PDF + document export consume),
 * runs the matching shared emitter from `./resources`, then wraps the result
 * in a `type: "searchset"` Bundle via the helpers here. Keeping the bundling,
 * paging, content-type and `OperationOutcome` shaping in one place means every
 * resource endpoint answers identically.
 *
 * Read-only: there are no write handlers anywhere under `/api/fhir`. Auth is a
 * narrow `fhir:read` Bearer scope (cookie sessions also pass); `userId` is
 * always narrowed from the auth context, never accepted from the wire.
