 * `bodySite.text`, because a receiver that ignores extensions must still read
 * "Knee (left)" rather than a bare "Knee".
 *
 * The side word is English on purpose. The builder takes no locale
 * (`FhirBuildOptions` carries none, unlike the PDF path), and every other
 * generated text in the Bundle is English: section titles, the Condition note,
 * the narratives. The site stays in the words the user wrote, so a German
 * record reads "Knie (left)", the same mix as a German label beside the
