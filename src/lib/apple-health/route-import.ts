/**
 * Workout GPS tracks from an Apple Health export, kept only on opt-in.
 *
 * `export.xml` names each workout's track as a `<FileReference>` to a GPX
 * file under `workout-routes/`. The XML pass hands those references here
 * (only when the account turned `storeWorkoutRoutes` on); this module then
 * reads the referenced members one at a time, parses each GPX as a stream,
 * thins it evenly to `MAX_ROUTE_POINTS`, and stores it sealed against the
 * workout the XML pass wrote.
 *
 * Memory: one member is held at a time, inflated into a buffer the archive
 * reader caps (`maxMemberBytes`), and its points are kept as flat number
 * arrays until they are thinned. Nothing about the track goes into the job
 * result, the logs or a wide event: only counts.
 *
 * A failure here never fails the import. The workouts and every measurement
 * are already committed; a track that cannot be read is counted and skipped.
