/**
 * OpenAPI route table — MCP connector credentials.
 *
 * Part of the OpenAPI route table; aggregated in `./index.ts`. The request
 * body comes from `src/lib/validations/mcp.ts` so the wire contract stays
 * single-source; the response DTOs mirror the handlers under
 * `src/app/api/mcp/*`.
 *
 * Two credential families reach the `/mcp` endpoint and both are managed here,
 * because a user revoking access needs one place that lists everything that can
 * read their record over MCP:
 *
 *   - A **connection** is what the OAuth bridge (`/api/mcp/oauth/*`) creates
 *     for a remote connector. It outlives the 60-minute access tokens it
 *     issues, so revoking the connection ends the whole refresh chain.
 *   - A **connector token** is the manual / stdio path: a `hlk_` Bearer minted
 *     here, scoped `health:read` (optionally plus `health:write`), never the
 *     `["*"]` wildcard.
 *
 * The OAuth routes themselves are deliberately absent: they answer RFC-format
 * error bodies rather than the standard envelope, and they are described by the
 * OAuth metadata documents, not by this contract.
