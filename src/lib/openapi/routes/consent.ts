/**
 * OpenAPI route table — AI consent receipts (v1.16.13).
 *
 * The `ConsentReceipt` family is the GDPR Art. 7 / App-Store 5.1.2(i)
 * audit trail and the precondition the server-managed AI-egress gate
 * (`src/lib/ai/consent-guard.ts`) enforces before any health snapshot
 * leaves for the operator's global LLM key. It shipped (commit 37e9f32f)
 * without a contract bump; this module documents the surface so iOS + web
 * clients have a stable reference.
 *
 * Receipt kinds: `ai_full` (master — satisfies every surface),
 * `ai_insights_only` (Insights only), `ai_coach` (Coach only),
 * `ai_extraction` (reading documents, lab report scans and typed medication
 * text; minted by the document auto-read switch).
 *
 * - POST /api/consent/ai      — explicit grant with a signed artefact (iOS).
 * - POST /api/consent/ai/web  — idempotent `ai_full` grant for the web
 *                               client. Without a body it is the AI-settings
 *                               mount heal (never lifts a revocation); with
 *                               `intent: "affirmative"` it is the explicit
 *                               grant control on the same surface.
 * - GET  /api/consent/ai/latest — latest active receipt(s).
 * - DELETE /api/consent/ai/latest — revoke the latest receipt (all kinds
 *                               when `kind` is omitted — the master OFF).
