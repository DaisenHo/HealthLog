/**
 * OpenAPI route table for structured family history (`/api/family-history`).
 *
 * Part of the OpenAPI route table; aggregated in `./index.ts`. The request
 * bodies + queries reuse the runtime Zod schemas from
 * `@/lib/validations/family-history` so the wire contract stays single-source.
 * Response shapes mirror the server-authoritative DTOs in
 * `@/lib/records/dto.ts` (the routes serialise a decrypted `note` the input
 * schemas don't carry; iOS renders the DTO, it never recomputes it).
 *
 * A structured FamilyMemberHistory-style RECORD — patient-reported, never a
 * clinical diagnosis. Owner-scoped; auth-gated.
