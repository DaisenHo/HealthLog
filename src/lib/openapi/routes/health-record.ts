    "v1.11.0 — owner request to mint a clinician share link to their own health record. `expiresAt` is required (absolute ISO instant) and capped at 90 days. `rangeStart`/`rangeEnd` freeze the reporting window (rangeEnd null = rolling). `selection` freezes which record leaves the link may serve, and omitting it means an empty scope rather than a default one. The `INSURANCE` leaf is refused outright (422, naming it): the share view has never decrypted the insurance number, and refusing it here makes that structural. `documentIds` freezes the documents the link carries; `documentOnly` mints a share that serves those documents and no record scope at all. A share link serves the rendered page, the documents frozen onto it, and the same record as a PDF or FHIR Bundle download under the token (`/c/{token}/report.pdf`, `/c/{token}/fhir`) — all behind the same gate and the same frozen selection.
