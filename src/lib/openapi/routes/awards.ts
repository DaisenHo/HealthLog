/**
 * OpenAPI route table — personal bests and badges.
 *
 * Part of the OpenAPI route table; aggregated in `./index.ts`.
 *
 * Two reads that belong together: `PersonalRecord` rows (the detected bests
 * per metric) and the derived achievement grid. Both are delegable — a
 * delegate reads what the RECORD earned, never a copy of their own tally
 * under the owner's name — and both are read-only in fact as well as in
 * declaration.
