/**
 * v1.17.0 — sleep-rhythm assembler (server-authoritative).
 *
 * The one place that turns a user's raw `SLEEP_DURATION` rows into the two
 * timing signals the Sleep page + the iOS client + the dashboard render:
 *
 *   - the outstanding SLEEP DEBT balance over the rolling window
 *     (`computeSleepDebt`; surplus sleep pays it down), and
 *   - MCTQ CHRONOTYPE + social jetlag (`computeChronotype`).
 *
 * ONE ENGINE, NO DUPLICATION
 * --------------------------
 * The per-night `asleepMinutes` and `midpointMinutes` come from the SAME
 * canonical reconstruction the Sleep Score reads — `reconstructNights`
 * (`sleep-score.ts`), which itself adapts `reconstructSleepNights`
 * (`sleep-night.ts`). This module does NOT re-cluster sessions, re-dedup
 * writers, or re-derive a midpoint; it maps the canonical night output onto
 * the two foundation modules' inputs and forwards the resolved `needMinutes`.
 * The math lives entirely in `sleep-debt.ts` / `chronotype.ts` — this file is
 * the adapter + DB read + day-type resolver, nothing else. Because the inputs
 * are the canonical totals, the debt headline and the chronotype band can
 * never contradict the dashboard / hypnogram / Sleep Score for the same night.
 *
 * DAY-TYPE SIGNAL (free vs work)
 * ------------------------------
 * Chronotype's MSF needs each night tagged free or work, and the app has no
 * work calendar. The documented DEFAULT is calendar-based: a night whose WAKE
 * day falls on Saturday or Sunday (in the user's timezone) is "free"; every
 * other night is "work". This mirrors the MCTQ assumption that weekends are
 * the alarm-free days for a standard work week — surfaced as a modelling
 * assumption, not a hidden constant. When a future per-night logged day-type
 * exists it overrides this default; until then weekday/weekend is the floor.
 *
 * Server-only — reads raw `SLEEP_DURATION` rows via Prisma, bounded to the
 * window. The DTO is the shared wire shape the route, the dashboard summary,
 * and the iOS serializer all emit identically.
