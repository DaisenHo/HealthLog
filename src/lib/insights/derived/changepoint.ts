/**
 * v1.22 — in-repo changepoint engine over DAY-bucket means.
 *
 * Replaces the vague "lately" with a dated, sustained LEVEL SHIFT:
 * "your resting heart rate stepped up around <date> and has held higher since".
 * This catches the clinically meaningful "changed-and-stayed" pattern a moving
 * trend line hides.
 *
 * The statistic is a single binary-segmentation / CUSUM-on-the-mean pass — no
 * PELT package, no new dependency (CONCEPT-3 §C1 prefers ~80 lines in-repo over
 * a vector/stats lib). We compute the cumulative deviation from the series mean,
 * take the index of maximum |CUSUM| as the candidate break, then VALIDATE the
 * split with a high firing bar so the detector never cries wolf on a spike:
 *
 *   - both segments must be long enough (a real regime, not an endpoint blip),
 *   - the post-break level must PERSIST (≥ `minPersistDays` after the break),
 *   - the level change must exceed the metric's own robust spread
 *     (|Δmean| ≥ `magnitudeK` · MAD · 1.4826), the personal yardstick, and
 *   - the series must be long enough overall,
 *   - the step must explain the series better than a straight line does
 *     (a slow drift splits into two halves with different means, but it is a
 *     drift, not a shift), and
 *   - with the per-metric floors the scan passes ({@link CHANGEPOINT_FLOORS}):
 *     the step must reach a minimum absolute size, and the spread it is
 *     measured against never drops below the device / clinical resolution,
 *     so a device that reports in 0.3 steps cannot make a 0.3 plateau change
 *     look like a many-sigma event.
 *
 * `magnitude` is capped at {@link MAX_MAGNITUDE} so the cross-metric ranking
 * is not won by whichever series happens to be the flattest.
 *
 * Below the bar the detector emits `null` and the Coach keeps saying "lately".
 * One changepoint per metric per window — no multi-break hunting in v1.22.
 *
 * The detector itself is PURE (`detectLevelShift` over `number[]`); the reader
 * (`buildChangepointSignals`) wraps it over the rollup tier for a small set of
 * stable metrics and maps the break index back to a calendar day.
