/**
 * v1.21.0 (FDREXTEND) — daily-series builders for the two cross-metric channels
 * the FDR correlation matrix could not previously see: medication compliance
 * and symptom severity.
 *
 * These are the SPARSEST, noisiest inputs in the system, so the builders are
 * deliberately conservative:
 *
 *  - **Compliance** is the per-day adherence rate (0–100) from the compliance
 *    engine's unified dose-history ledger. Only days the cadence ACTUALLY
 *    expected a dose produce a point (off-cadence / off-week days emit nothing),
 *    so a sparse schedule never fabricates a 0%-or-100% point on a day it did
 *    not dose. The ledger's `at` instant is re-keyed to the user's display tz
 *    here (the engine's `dailyComplianceRatesFromLedger` keys in fixed Berlin),
 *    so the day-key basis aligns with every other discovery series.
 *
 *  - **Symptom severity** is the illness day-log functional-impact / symptom
 *    burden (0–3). The logged days are SPARSE and, on their own, often
 *    constant (a short flare logged at impact 2 for three days is a flat line
 *    with no variance — Pearson cannot use it). To make the actionable
 *    "adherence dip → symptom flare" link discoverable we zero-fill HEALTHY
 *    days, but ONLY across the span of the user's real episodes (onset →
 *    resolved/window-end) intersected with the window. A user who never logs an
 *    illness episode yields an EMPTY series, so the channel DEGRADES TO ABSENT
 *    rather than to a spurious all-zero constant. Within an episode span, days
 *    the user didn't log are treated as 0 (healthy) — the same constant-0
 *    healthy baseline the recovery-gap symptom track already uses.
 *
 * Both series then flow UNCHANGED through `discoverCorrelations` — the n ≥ 20
 * paired-day floor, the BH-FDR control, the effect-size floor, and the
 * James-Stein shrinkage all apply exactly as they do to every vital channel.
 * Nothing here computes a statistic; these are pure series shapers.
 *
 * Pure over already-fetched rows — the DB reads live in the caller (the route),
 * mirroring how the engine itself is pure over `NamedSeries[]`.
