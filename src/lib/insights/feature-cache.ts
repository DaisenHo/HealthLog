/**
 * v1.18.11 — request/run-scoped shared feature cache.
 *
 * The comprehensive briefing builds its feature snapshot via
 * `extractFeatures(userId, includeRaw, { sinceDays })`. That call materialises a
 * bounded measurement read + the per-type rollup folds + the all-time-extremes
 * aggregation — the most expensive read in the insight pipeline. Two patterns
 * paid for it more than once:
 *
 *   1. The on-demand route + `comprehensive-generate.ts` each run a downgrade
 *      ladder that, on an oversize payload, re-invokes
 *      `extractFeatures(userId, false, window)` with byte-identical arguments —
 *      a second (and third) full read for the same user in the same request.
 *   2. A single nightly tick warms one user's briefing and may, in the same
 *      run-scope, touch the same feature read again (e.g. a follow-on reduce
 *      stage). Without a shared object each consumer re-queried the DB.
 *
 * This module turns `extractFeatures` into a compute-ONCE-per-scope read: a
 * caller opens a scope with `withFeatureCacheScope(...)`, and every
 * `getCachedFeatures(...)` inside that scope keyed on the SAME
 * `(userId, calendar-day, includeRaw, sinceDays, inputHash)` reuses the first
 * computed object. This is an INPUT gate (compute-once + reuse), not a
 * post-build skip: the key folds a cheap input fingerprint so an unchanged
 * input set is computed once and a genuinely changed one recomputes.
 *
 * Scope discipline:
 *   - The cache lives only for the duration of the `withFeatureCacheScope`
 *     callback (an `AsyncLocalStorage` store). Outside any scope
 *     `getCachedFeatures` falls straight through to the computer — no global
 *     state, no cross-user leak, no stale-across-requests hazard.
 *   - The key is `(userId, day, includeRaw, sinceDays, inputHash)`. `day` is
 *     the user's own calendar day (v1.30.3 QA F5 — was Berlin-pinned for
 *     every user) so a scope that straddles the user's local midnight
 *     recomputes rather than serving yesterday's window. `inputHash` is a cheap
 *     count/newest fingerprint of the salient measurement + mood inputs, so a
 *     mid-scope ingest (rare, but possible on a long-running warm) recomputes
 *     instead of reusing a pre-ingest snapshot.
 *
 * The Coach owns its own snapshot builder and is deliberately NOT routed
 * through here (its snapshot layers many blocks beyond `extractFeatures`); this
 * cache is exposed as a standalone helper either could adopt without coupling.
