/**
 * v1.12.1 — feed FDR-surviving cross-metric correlations into the
 * per-metric assessment card.
 *
 * The discovery engine (`correlation-discovery.ts`) already computes, with
 * a real Pearson + exact p-value + Benjamini-Hochberg FDR control, which
 * behaviour×outcome pairs are statistically defensible. Until now that
 * intelligence only reached the period narrative; the per-metric cards —
 * where many users actually live — never saw it, so every card read in
 * isolation ("your resting HR is X") instead of relationally ("your
 * resting HR rose the same week your sleep dropped").
 *
 * This module runs the SAME full-matrix discovery the
 * `/api/insights/correlations` route runs (so a card never surfaces a pair
 * the correlations page wouldn't), then filters to the surviving pairs that
 * INVOLVE the current metric's discovery channel. That parity is structural
 * rather than asserted: both take their channel set from the one assembler in
 * `src/lib/insights/discovery-matrix.ts`, and
 * `src/__tests__/discovery-matrix-guard.test.ts` freezes the assembler as the
 * only place a matrix is built. The result is the engine's own conservative,
 * descriptive, never-causal `interpretation` strings — passed verbatim into
 * the prompt as grounded context.
 *
 * Read-only consumption. No new statistics are computed here; the only
 * changes vs the route are the filter to one metric and the raw (rather than
 * rollup-tiered) measurement read.
