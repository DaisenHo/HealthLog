/**
 * v1.15.20 — soft-deleted rows must never reach an AI prompt snapshot.
 *
 * The user-facing DELETE flips `deletedAt` instead of removing the row,
 * so every prompt-feeding read has to filter the tombstones explicitly.
 * Three status generators (general / weight / bmi) and the Coach
 * snapshot's intake read shipped without the filter; this guard pins
 * the `deletedAt: null` predicate at each of those call sites so a
 * future query rewrite cannot silently drop it (same source-guard
 * pattern the queue-registration tests use).
