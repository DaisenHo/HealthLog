/**
 * Structural guard: the link tables have exactly one gateway.
 *
 * `src/lib/links/` owns every read and write of the narrow link tables this
 * venture introduced — the three encounter link tables, the document↔condition
 * table, and the vaccination↔document table. The whole point of routing both
 * link families through one module with one signature is that #203's later
 * absorption of these tables into a single join model is a storage change here,
 * not a sweep across every route that files something. That property is only
 * real if nothing outside the module touches the tables directly, and a claim
 * about "nothing outside" is exactly what a structural guard can hold and a
 * behavioural test cannot.
 *
 * This is a tripwire, not a proof. It cannot show the service is correct — only
 * that a call to one of its tables has not appeared outside it without someone
 * editing this file. A reviewer who waves through a new exemption defeats it.
 *
 * Its own limit, stated so a future reader does not mistake it for more than it
 * is: the matcher recognises a delegate accessed off `prisma` or `tx`, the two
 * client identifiers this codebase uses. A transaction bound to some other name
 * would slip it. That is the same class of limit the Bearer-scope and
 * session-surface guards document about themselves, and the mitigation is the
 * same: the matcher is proven non-vacuous below (it MUST match inside the
 * module), so it cannot silently match nothing and pass for the wrong reason.
