/**
 * The sleep-arrival trigger for the morning digest refresh.
 *
 * The nightly insight pre-pass (`insight-pregenerate`, 04:30) runs before last
 * night's sleep has synced, so the morning digest + health score reference the
 * day WITHOUT the current sleep. This trigger closes that gap the event-driven
 * way: when a completed sleep segment for LAST NIGHT lands from any sleep
 * transport (Withings sync-sleep / the WHOOP sync / the Apple-Health
 * measurement batch / Google Health / Fitbit / Oura / Polar), it enqueues a debounced
 * `morning-digest-refresh` job that re-runs the sleep-dependent generation and
 * flips the day `provisional → final`.
 *
 * There is no single canonical sleep-persist function in the tree — each
 * transport upserts through its own helper — so every write seam calls
 * `maybeEnqueueMorningRefresh` with the measuredAt of every sleep row it just
 * wrote. The debounce (queue `singletonKey` + the `User.morningDigestRefreshedOn`
 * marker) collapses the many samples of one night, and across all sources,
 * into ONE refresh per user per local morning.
 *
 * Timezone correctness is load-bearing: "last night" is judged in the user's
 * PROFILE timezone, never UTC, so a 30-day backfill re-sync never re-triggers
 * for historical nights and a sleep that is "last night" locally but a
 * different UTC date still triggers.
