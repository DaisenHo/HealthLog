/**
 * Shared post-mutation tail for every surface that creates, updates,
 * deletes, or restores `Measurement` rows.
 *
 * Two consumers hang off every measurement write and both were being
 * re-remembered by hand at each write surface (the documented two-ended
 * failure class):
 *
 *   1. the `(type, day)` rollup buckets the mutation dirtied — recomputed
 *      inline (DAY) + enqueued (WEEK/MONTH/YEAR) via
 *      `recomputeBucketsForMeasurement`. The recompute handles deletions
 *      inherently: a day left empty drops its rollup row.
 *   2. the cached per-metric status assessments — re-warmed via
 *      `invalidateStatusInsightsForTypes` (fire-and-forget).
 *
 * Both legs are best-effort: a populator hiccup never fails the user's
 * mutation. Callers collect the affected `(type, measuredAt)` pairs
 * (for deletes: BEFORE the destructive statement, while the rows are
 * still readable) and hand them here.
