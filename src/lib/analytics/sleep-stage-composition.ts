/**
 * Stage composition for the insights sleep chart — per-night stage minutes
 * over a trailing window, with the day's naps kept OUT of the night.
 *
 * A nap ends on the same wake day as that morning's overnight block, so the
 * per-wake-day totals that back the headline number fold the two together.
 * That is right for "how much did I sleep on this day" and wrong for "what was
 * my night made of": an 80-minute afternoon nap lands as CORE on top of the
 * night and the column reads longer and shallower than the night actually was.
 *
 * So the composition is built from SESSIONS, split by the one nap classifier
 * this codebase has (`pickMainNightAndNaps`, via `separateNightsAndNaps`). The
 * night's stages are the main session's stages. The naps ride along as their
 * own minutes on the same day, never inside the stage buckets.
 *
 * Pure — the caller does the bounded DB read.
