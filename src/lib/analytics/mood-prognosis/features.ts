/**
 * One row per day, one column per thing the day was made of.
 *
 * The target is the day's own pleasantness (A1) and everything else is an
 * input: the other four level-A dimensions, the numbers and the closed
 * vocabularies of the day's context, and the figures the sleep, activity and
 * recovery modules already hold for that day. A1 is the only target on
 * purpose — five targets would be five ways to be wrong and five bands to
 * explain.
 *
 * Four rules this file is built on, each of which has a way of being got
 * wrong that looks fine on screen:
 *
 * 1. **Nothing is imputed. Ever.** A day with a missing input is not a day
 *    with an average input. The stated rule is complete cases: a day enters
 *    the fit only if it carries the target and every SELECTED feature, and a
 *    feature only becomes a candidate if it was recorded on at least
 *    {@link MIN_FEATURE_COVERAGE} of the days that carry a target. The
 *    coverage floor is what keeps the complete-case rule from quietly
 *    emptying the matrix: without it, one field somebody filled in twice
 *    would exclude every other day they ever logged.
 * 2. **Standardised per user, not min-max.** A person whose stress never
 *    exceeds six must not have six read as "maximum stress". The mean and the
 *    spread come from their own fit window, so every feature is expressed in
 *    that person's own units — which is also what makes the stored
 *    contributions comparable to each other.
 * 3. **Screened before it is fitted, with the multiple-comparison correction
 *    the rest of the product already runs.** A sweep over sixty context
 *    features at raw p < 0.05 finds three things that are not there. Pearson
 *    with the shared `MIN_PAIRED_N` floor, Benjamini-Hochberg at the shared
 *    `FDR_Q`, and the shared effect-size floor on the shrunk estimate — all
 *    imported, none re-tuned here.
 * 4. **Orientation comes from the table that owns it.** A2 is inverse and is
 *    flipped through `MOOD_DIMENSIONS[i].inverse`, never inline, so the chart
 *    and the model read one source. Context ratings are NOT flipped: no table
 *    states their orientation, and inventing one here would be exactly the
 *    second opinion the dimension table exists to prevent. It costs nothing
 *    mathematically — a flip only changes the sign of a coefficient, and the
 *    stored contribution is signed anyway.
