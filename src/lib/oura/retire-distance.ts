/**
 * Retire the `WALKING_RUNNING_DISTANCE` rows earlier Oura syncs wrote from
 * `equivalent_walking_distance`.
 *
 * That field is an activity equivalent (the distance a walk of the day's
 * effort would have covered), not distance travelled, so the rows were wrong
 * from the start and the sync no longer writes them (`mapDailyActivity`).
 * What is already stored is soft-deleted here, in bounded batches, and the
 * touched days are refolded through the shared mutation tail so the rollups
 * stop counting them, the same way `retireOuraSleepRecords` retires a
 * rejected sleep period.
 *
 * Only rows the activity mapper keyed (`activity:<day>:distance`) of source
 * OURA match; another source's distance, and any OURA row of another shape,
 * stay. Idempotent: a second run finds nothing live and returns 0. The Oura
 * backfill runs it before anything else on every connected account, and the
 * backfill's discovery also offers an account that still holds such rows
 * after its Oura connection was removed.
