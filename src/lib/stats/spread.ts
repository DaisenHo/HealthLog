/**
 * Variance and standard deviation, with the kind named at every call site.
 *
 * - `population` divides by n: the spread of exactly these readings. It is
 *   what a surface reports when it describes a series the person can see.
 * - `sample` divides by n − 1: an estimate of the spread that readings like
 *   these come from. It belongs where the spread feeds a decision (a
 *   significance verdict, a changepoint threshold) or where a clinical
 *   definition asks for it.
 *
 * The two differ by sqrt(n / (n − 1)), about 22 % at n = 3, so one series
 * shown with both rules looks like two different series. Every hand-rolled
 * spread used to pick its rule silently; the API reported the population SD
 * of a blood-pressure series while the MCP and AI payload reported the
 * sample SD of the same readings.
