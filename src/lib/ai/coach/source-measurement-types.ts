/**
 * CoachScopeSource → MeasurementType[] mapping.
 *
 * Extracted out of `snapshot.ts` (where it lived as a function-local literal)
 * so the availability probe reads the SAME table the windowed snapshot read
 * builds its `WHERE type IN (…)` from. The probe answers "does this domain
 * exist at all, outside the window?" — if it resolved its types from a second
 * copy of this table, a new metric could be windowed by one map and probed by
 * the other, and the two would disagree silently. One table, two readers.
 *
 * `mood`, `compliance`, and `workouts` map to no `MeasurementType` because they
 * read separate models (MoodEntry / MedicationIntakeEvent / Workout); the
 * availability probe carries its own subject kinds for those. `glucose` also
 * reads `Measurement` but needs the `glucoseContext` column, so its snapshot
 * block is built separately rather than from the shared rows.
