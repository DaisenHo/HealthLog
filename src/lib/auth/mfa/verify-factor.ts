/**
 * Verify a presented second factor (TOTP or recovery code) for a user, with
 * the side effects that make each factor single-use:
 *
 * - **TOTP:** decrypt the stored secret (fail-closed), validate with ±1 drift
 *   and monotonic replay rejection, and on success **persist the accepted
 *   time-step** so the same code cannot be replayed within its 30-second life.
 * - **Recovery code:** Argon2id-verify against the unused set and burn the
 *   matched row.
 *
 * Used by the login-completion route (`/api/auth/mfa/verify`), the Bearer
 * step-up mint, the step-up-gated MFA-disable route and the credential
 * re-proof in `existing-factor-proof.ts`, so the factor semantics are
 * identical wherever a current factor must be proven.
 *
 * **Only a CONFIRMED secret is a factor.** `/me/mfa/totp/setup` writes a
 * pending secret for anyone holding the session, so a code from a secret
 * whose `totpConfirmedAt` is still null proves only that the caller started
 * an enrollment — never that they hold a factor the account owner set up.
 * Accepting it would let a stolen session mint its own "second factor" and
 * spend it on every gate this function guards. Recovery codes follow the same
 * rule: they exist only for a confirmed factor, and are refused otherwise.
