 * WHOOP cycle ingest used the narrow 1 h default overlap while workout /

 * day (or fetched just after the cursor stepped past it) then fell before the
 * incremental `start` and its final value was never re-fetched. This pins cycle
 * onto the SAME overlap the other collections use (the upsert is idempotent).
