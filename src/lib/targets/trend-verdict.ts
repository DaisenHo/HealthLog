/**
 * Which way a change of a metric counts as progress, for this person (v1.43,
 * ios #116 item 3). The generalisation of `resolveWeightTrend`.
 *
 * Every surface that shows a change (a dashboard arrow, a seven-day delta, a
 * target tile, a chart's first-to-last change) used to carry its own fixed
 * polarity: a rising blood pressure turned orange whatever the person's
 * target was, and the native client kept a third copy of the table. The
 * verdict is resolved here, once, and published on every route that serves a
 * change; clients colour from it and never decide it themselves.
 *
 * The rule:
 *
 *   - a band applies (the person's own target from `/targets`, else a
 *     profile-derived default: the age-based blood pressure target, the
 *     age- and sex-based resting pulse band, the sex-based body fat band):
 *       below the band  → a rise is progress   (`up-good`)
 *       above the band  → a fall is progress   (`up-bad`)
 *       inside the band → holding is progress  (`hold`)
 *   - two exceptions to "below / above":
 *       a low reading of a load measure (blood pressure, resting pulse, body
 *       fat) against a band nobody chose is `hold`, not `up-good`. A
 *       default band's lower edge is a population convention, not a goal:
 *       a well-trained resting pulse of 48 or a systolic of 108 is not
 *       something to climb out of, and painting its fall orange would tell
 *       the person to raise it. Only a target the person set themselves
 *       turns "below" into "a rise is progress".
 *       a one-sided measure (steps, oxygen saturation) above its band is
 *       `hold`, never `up-bad`: more steps than the target, or a saturation
 *       above it, is never a setback.
 *   - no band, or no value to place: the metric's own default direction.
 *
 * Weight keeps its own rule (`weight-trend.ts`): only a target the person set
 * counts, never the height-derived band, because a band nobody chose says
 * nothing about which way they want to move.
 *
 * Pure and client-safe: no DB read, no clock beyond the age the profile
 * helpers compute.
