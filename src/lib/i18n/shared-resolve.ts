/**
 * Server-side message-bundle map + re-export of the shared key resolver.
 *
 * v1.4.27 — client and server previously each carried
 * their own private copy of `allMessages` plus a near-identical
 * `resolveKey` helper; pinning both to one import stopped the maps
 * drifting when a locale was added.
 *
 * Since the i18n bundle split, `allMessages` is SERVER-ONLY: the root
 * layout picks the active locale's bundle out of it for the RSC handoff
 * and `getServerTranslator()` resolves against it. Do NOT import this
 * module from client code — the seven static JSON imports would drag
 * every locale back into the client chunk (the ~1.4 MiB regression the
 * split removed). Client code uses `./load-locale` (static EN fallback
 * floor + dynamic per-locale imports) and `./resolve-key` instead.
