/**
 * Match indexes derived from the shipped message bundles.
 *
 * The recurring defect this closes: a resolver that has to turn a
 * user-authored word ("Fer", "Żelazo", "Sommeil") into an internal code
 * transcribes the ENGLISH display names into a hand-typed table in the
 * source. Five of the six shipped locales then resolve to nothing, even
 * though their translations are already on disk in `messages/<locale>.json`
 * and are already what the app renders for the same concept.
 *
 * The fix is to stop transcribing. A caller names the i18n key that already
 * labels the concept; this module reads that key out of EVERY entry in
 * `locales` and builds the folded-name → value index. Adding a locale to
 * `locales` and shipping its bundle is then the whole change — no edit here,
 * and no edit at any call site.
 *
 * SERVER-ONLY, like `shared-resolve` (whose `allMessages` it reads): pulling
 * this into a client chunk would drag all six catalogs back in. Both current
 * consumers are MCP reads, which are server-side by construction.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a translation layer for OUTPUT. The MCP surface answers in
 * protocol-level English on purpose (see `nutrients-read.ts` and the
 * `metric-status-registry`'s `displayName` comment); this module only widens
 * what the resolver ACCEPTS.
