/**
 * v1.36.0 — entering and leaving somebody else's record, from the browser.
 *
 * The switch is four acts in a fixed browser-coordination order:
 *
 *   1. **Hold every tab.** Publish a cross-tab `blocking` transition and clear
 *      local reads before the POST can change the shared server session.
 *   2. **Ask the server.** `POST /api/account/switch` validates the grant and
 *      stamps the session. Any client-visible failure stays held until a
 *      fresh `/api/auth/me` resolves the record the server actually kept; it
 *      never restores stale caches.
 *   3. **Empty every cache that survives a reload.** The IndexedDB query
 *      snapshot and the service worker's `healthlog-data-*` cache both answer
 *      reads from disk. Left in place, the first paint on the other side can
 *      be the PREVIOUS record's numbers under a banner naming the new one —
 *      and nothing in the page's own code would be wrong, because the answer
 *      would not have come from the page. Awaited, not fired: a wipe racing
 *      the navigation is a wipe that sometimes does not happen.
 *   4. **Reload the document.** Not `router.refresh()`, not a query
 *      invalidation. A hard navigation is what discards the in-memory cache,
 *      every React state tree holding a rendered value, and every in-flight
 *      request that was issued against the old record. The reload IS the cache
 *      flush; the two lines above it are the parts a reload cannot reach.
 *
 * The hook returns from step 1 and never from step 3 — the page is gone.
 * Callers therefore do not need a success state, only a pending one.
