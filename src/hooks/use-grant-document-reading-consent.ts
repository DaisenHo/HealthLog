 * Grant the consent for reading documents (`ai_extraction`) from the place

 *
 * Sending a document, a lab report scan or a typed medication description to
 * an AI service outside this server needs its own receipt. The narrow kind
 * covers exactly that and never the Coach or AI analysis, so asking for it
 * where a document is being read asks for no more than the reader is about to
 * do. The tap on the prompt IS the consent act; the receipt records it with
 * its source, the same way the web settings record a full grant.
 *
 * On success `/api/auth/me` is refetched, because the capabilities it
 * publishes (`documentAi`, `labsOcr`, `medicationExtract`) are what every
 * reading surface renders from.
