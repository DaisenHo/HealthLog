 * One reconstructed night from `GET /api/sleep/night?date=YYYY-MM-DD`.
 *
 * The date is the WAKE day: the night a person woke from into that day.
 * The server owns the reconstruction (stage folding, cross-source pick,
 * WHOOP timeline synthesis) and the day keying, so this hook only carries
 * the resolved figures across.
 *
 * The route is gated on the `sleep` module and answers 403 when it is off.
 * Callers gate the mount on `useModuleEnabled("sleep")` so a switched-off
 * module never paints as a failed read.
