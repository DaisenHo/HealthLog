/**
 * `DELETE /api/cycle/cycles/{id}` — soft-delete a cycle
 * (ios-contract §2.F): set `deletedAt` + bump `syncVersion`, emit a
 * tombstone on the next sync page. 204. Idempotent. Owner-scoped + gated.
 * With `Prefer: return=representation` (v1.43, RFC 7240) the answer is 200
 * with what the delete changed — the removed cycle and the starts it gave
 * back — so a client can say "the start on 17 Sep is back".
 *
 * The delete also hands the span back to the preceding cycle. Opening a cycle
 * closes the one before it, so removing it without re-deriving that boundary
 * left the previous cycle standing as a closed torso with an end date taken
 * from a cycle that no longer exists — and a record whose last cycle is closed
 * has no open cycle to forecast from.
