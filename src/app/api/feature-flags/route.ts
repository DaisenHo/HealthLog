/**
 * `GET /api/feature-flags` — the operator's assistant switches. DEPRECATED.
 *
 * The answer a client needs is not the switch set but what the switches, the
 * record's modules, the provider-work authority, the provider and consent add
 * up to, per capability. That is `ai` on `GET /api/auth/me`, and it is what
 * every client reads from this release on. This route stays a projection of
 * the operator switches alone, for clients that have not moved yet, and is
 * removed in the first release after the native build that reads `ai` ships:
 *
 *   { "data": { "assistant": { "enabled", "coach", "briefing",
 *                              "insightStatus", "documentAi" } } }
 *
 * The master is applied (every sub-switch reads false when it is off), and a
 * switch read that fails answers every switch off. The response carries the
 * deprecation date, the sunset and a `Link` to its successor
 * (`src/lib/http/deprecation.ts`), and the wide event names the client build
 * that still asked.
 *
 * `Cache-Control: private, max-age=60`: switches flip rarely.
