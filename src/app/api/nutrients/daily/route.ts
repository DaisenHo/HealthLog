/**
 * `GET /api/nutrients/daily?nutrient=<code>&days=N` — per-day summed
 * series for one nutrient, plus its resolved EFSA reference (v1.29).
 *
 * Feeds the `/insights/nutrients` hydration + caffeine charts: a dense
 * day-bucketed series (one row per calendar day in the window, 0 for a
 * day with no logged data) summed ACROSS sources — a day can carry an
 * APPLE_HEALTH row and a MANUAL row since migration 0249, and the
 * chart shows one honest bar per day. The window is anchored to the
 * caller's own local "today" (`User.timezone`), not a UTC floor —
 * unlike the coarser window on `GET /api/nutrients`, a chart with a
 * one-day edge wobble reads as a visible bug.
 *
 * The reference resolves against the caller's profile sex (from the
 * session's own `User` row — no extra query) and is `null` when the
 * profile has no sex on file, matching the catalog's own contract:
 * omit, never guess. Module-gated like every other nutrients route.
