/**
 * `GET /api/account/activity` — who opened this account's record, and when.
 *
 * The owner's side of the audit actor. Every row filed under this account that
 * somebody ELSE performed, newest first: the day-coalesced read rows the
 * delegated resolver writes, and any delegated action that lands an audit row
 * of its own. Rows the owner performed themselves are absent by construction —
 * `actorUserId` is null for those, and this feed is not a second copy of the
 * security-activity feed.
 *
 * **The window is published, not implied.** `retentionDays` rides the response
 * because audit rows are purged on a schedule the operator configures
 * (`AUDIT_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS`, 365 by default) and a view that showed "the
 * activity" without saying how far back it goes would claim a completeness it
 * does not have. The number is resolved server-side from the same function the
 * purge job uses, so the sentence in the UI cannot drift from the job that
 * makes it true — an instance running a 90-day window says 90.
 *
 * **And the window is now enforced, not only stated.** The query is bounded to
 * it. Without the filter the two halves of the same sentence disagreed: the
 * revoke dialog promised attribution "for the next N days" while this read
 * returned whatever the last hundred rows happened to be, which on a quiet
 * record reaches back past a shortened retention window and on a busy one
 * covers a fortnight. The bound the copy states is the bound the query uses.
 *
 * **The row cap says when it was hit.** A hundred rows is a display bound, and
 * a list that silently stops at its own ceiling is the more dangerous of the
 * two completeness lies — an owner scrolling to the bottom reads the oldest
 * line as the beginning. `truncated` is true when the cap was reached, and the
 * view says it is showing the most recent activity rather than all of it.
 * `false` means the list IS everything inside the window.
 *
 * Not delegable: bare `requireAuth()` refuses under a switch. A delegate must
 * not be able to read the owner's record of who has been in it — that list
 * names other delegates, and a grant is not an introduction to the household.
