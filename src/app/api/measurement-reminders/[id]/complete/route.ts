/**
 * v1.18.6 — explicit "complete" for a Vorsorge reminder (iOS #23 follow-up).
 *
 * The user-action equivalent of the cron auto-satisfy: the iOS app (and web)
 * call this when the user actively marks a measurement reminder done, rather
 * than only dismissing the notification locally. It routes through the ONE
 * shared `satisfyReminder` primitive — the same code the cron auto-resolve
 * and the eventful ingest worker use — so it:
 *
 *   - stamps `lastSatisfiedAt = now` and re-anchors the server-authoritative
 *     `nextDueAt` past now (one engine, no duplicated reschedule logic);
 *   - fires NO notification of its own (the primitive only writes the row;
 *     the dispatcher is never invoked on this path);
 *   - is idempotent via the primitive's forward-only guard — completing an
 *     already-completed / auto-satisfied reminder is a no-op that still
 *     returns 200, with `completed: false` so the client can tell the second
 *     tap apart from the first.
 *
 * Distinct from `satisfy` only in that the response surfaces the `completed`
 * flag the explicit-action flow benefits from; the underlying effect is the
 * shared satisfaction primitive either way.
