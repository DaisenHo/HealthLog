/**
 * GET /api/fhir/metadata — FHIR R4 `CapabilityStatement`.
 *
 * Declares the read-only REST face: the resource types served, the `read` +
 * `search-type` interactions on each, the search parameters honoured
 * (`_count`, `_offset`; `date` and `code` on Observation), the
 * `Patient-everything` operation, and the
 * `application/fhir+json` format. Static — no per-user data — but still gated
 * behind the `fhir:read` scope so the whole `/api/fhir` tree answers
 * uniformly. Read-only: no write interactions are advertised.
 *
 * Every entry here is backed by a route. `FHIR_REST_RESOURCE_TYPES` is the one
 * catalogue the resource entries derive from, and each type in it has both a
 * `/{type}` search route and a `/{type}/{id}` read route; the operation is
 * routed at `/api/fhir/Patient/$everything`. A statement that advertises an
 * interaction a client cannot reach is worse than one that stays quiet.
