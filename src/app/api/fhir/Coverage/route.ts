/**
 * GET /api/fhir/Coverage — FHIR R4 `searchset` of the caller's own insurance Coverage.
 *
 * Present only when an insurer is known — R4 requires a payor, and a record
 * that carries only a member id has none, so the search is empty rather than
 * carrying a Coverage that names nobody.
 *
 * Read-only. `userId` is narrowed from `requireAuth`; the shared emitters in
 * `@/lib/fhir/resources` are the single source of the coding, so this face and
 * the document export can never describe the same record differently. Offset
 * paging via `_count` (clamped ≤200) / `_offset`.
