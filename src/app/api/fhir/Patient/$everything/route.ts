/**
 * GET /api/fhir/Patient/$everything — FHIR R4 `Patient-everything`.
 *
 * Returns every resource in the caller's own record in one `searchset` Bundle:
 * the Composition, the authoring Device, Patient, Coverage, every Observation
 * (vitals / glucose / labs / adherence / mood / wellness AND the cycle set),
 * MedicationStatements, MedicationAdministrations, Conditions, Encounters,
 * AllergyIntolerances, FamilyMemberHistories and the DiagnosticReport (present
 * when the window holds a vital sign).
 *
 * The set is the document export's, flattened — same builder, same order, same
 * `urn:uuid` entry identities, so a reference between two resources still
 * resolves inside the response and the operation can never quietly carry less
 * than the document does.
 *
 * Read-only; `userId` narrowed from `requireAuth`. A browser session needs a
 * recent sign-in or re-proof (`assertRecentCookieProof`). Offset paging applies across
 * the flattened resource list via `_count` (clamped ≤200) / `_offset`.
