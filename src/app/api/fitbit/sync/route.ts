/**
 * Manually trigger a Fitbit sync for the current user.
 *
 * Mirrors the WHOOP manual-sync route: incremental by default, full history when
 * `{ fullSync: true }` is posted.
 *
 * Rate-limited: every sibling Fitbit route (connect / test / resume) is limited;
 * this one was the outlier, while `{ fullSync: true }` drives four resource syncs
 * over the classic Web API's tight 150 req/h-per-user budget. A tight loop or a
 * stolen native token could exhaust that budget and pin Prisma. A baseline 5/60s
 * bucket (matching the test route) gates the route, and the expensive `fullSync`
 * path carries a tighter 1/hour bucket of its own.
