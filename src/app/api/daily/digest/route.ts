/**
 * GET /api/daily/digest
 *
 * The read seam for the unified daily-value system (P3). Returns the
 * `DailyDigest` DTO the Today surface, the daily push, and a future iOS widget
 * all consume — assembled by `loadDailyDigest` from ALREADY-CACHED data (the
 * nightly briefing lifted read-only from `User.insightsCachedTextEncrypted`, the
 * dashboard-snapshot health score / meds-today / sleep freshness) plus two
 * light deterministic reads (broken integrations, overdue Vorsorge). No
 * provider call is reachable from this path, and nothing warms on mount.
 *
 * Cookie OR Bearer auth via `requireAuth()`; `userId` is narrowed from the
 * resolved session — never a body field. No module gate and no AI gate: the
 * digest is data (score, doses, syncs, checkups, the day's markers). Its AI
 * parts, the briefing lead, the reaction line and the Coach check-in, are
 * served only while their capabilities are available, and the `ai` block says
 * which. The rail's data-tile inputs inherit their own module gates via the
 * snapshot builder.
