/**
 * v1.10.0 — device-flagged event awareness route (categorical events,
 * WX-B).
 *
 * `GET /api/insights/rhythm-events` returns the authenticated user's
 * timeline of device-flagged EVENT rows — irregular-rhythm /
 * high-HR / low-HR / walking-steadiness / breathing-disturbance
 * notifications the user's wearable (Apple Watch / Withings ScanWatch)
 * already produced and synced.
 *
 * Regulatory framing (load-bearing): this surface is AWARENESS / SCREENING
 * of the DEVICE's own decision. HealthLog stores and reflects ONLY the
 * classification RESULT the device's FDA-cleared / CE-marked on-device
 * algorithm emitted. It never ingests a raw ECG waveform, never
 * re-classifies, and never produces a HealthLog diagnosis. The verdict the
 * client renders (`rhythmClassification`) is the device's, verbatim.
 *
 * Data-availability-gated by construction: an account with no event rows
 * gets `{ events: [], hasEvents: false }`, and the client un-mounts the
 * whole surface rather than painting an empty / alarming card.
 *
 * Follows the `metric-status` / `derived` route precedent: `apiHandler`
 * wrapper, cookie OR Bearer auth, `userId` narrowed from the session
 * (never a query field). No AI gate and no module gate: this is a pure DB
 * read of device data.
