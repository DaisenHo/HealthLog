/**
 * v1.11.0 — period-narrative read route (Pillar P1).
 *
 * `GET /api/insights/narrative?period=week|month` serves the latest generated
 * period summary for the calling user. Read-only by construction (the v1.8.3
 * freeze posture): it NEVER blocks on the provider. It returns the last good
 * narrative immediately (stale-while-revalidate) and, when the row is missing
 * or stale and a provider is configured, fire-and-forget enqueues a warm so
 * the next read reflects the latest period.
 *
 * `userId` is narrowed from the session/Bearer (never a query field); an
 * unknown `period` 422s via the closed enum.
 *
 * A mixed read. The narrative is data when the deterministic composer wrote
 * it and model output when a provider did. Model-written text is served only
 * while the record's `periodNarrative` capability is available (answered from
 * the record's own state, so a delegate reads the owner's narrative exactly
 * when the owner would); otherwise `narrative` is null and `ai` says why. The
 * warm is enqueued only when the capability is available, or when no row
 * exists at all (the worker then writes the deterministic narrative); never
 * for a delegate. The `insights` module is the AI analysis
 * opt-out and is folded into the capability, so it no longer refuses the
 * route.
