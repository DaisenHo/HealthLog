/**
 * GET /api/insights/coach/nudge-status — is there an unread Coach
 * message the caller has not opened yet?
 *
 * v1.18.6 — the proactive Coach nudge now lands as a real
 * ASSISTANT message in the conversation rail (CCH-02), not as a
 * notification-only dispatch. The unread signal moved with it: instead
 * of anchoring on the `push_attempts` ledger (which is empty when no
 * push channel is configured, so the nudge was invisible), the status
 * compares the newest Coach assistant message against the
 * server-authoritative `User.coachLastSeenAt` stamp.
 *
 * `unread` is true when an assistant message exists that is newer than
 * the last time the user opened the Coach (drawer or page, which writes
 * `coachLastSeenAt` via `POST /api/insights/coach/seen`). A user who has
 * never opened the Coach reads any existing nudge as unread exactly
 * once. Server-authoritative so the signal is consistent across web +
 * iOS; the FAB keeps a local mirror only as an instant-paint
 * optimisation.
 *
 * `nudgedAt` carries the newest assistant-message timestamp so the FAB's
 * local seen-stamp keys on a stable value (kept for the existing client
 * contract).
 *
 * A mixed read: while the record's `coach` capability is unavailable
 * (operator switch, opt-out, no provider, no consent) the route still answers
 * 200, with the
 * quiet shape `{ unread: false, nudgedAt: null, conversationId: null }` and
 * an `ai` state saying why. There is no Coach to open, so there is nothing
 * unread, and no app-open reminder is evaluated.

  // FAB while a switch is on, but this route is in the refusal log precisely
  // because the query fires before `/api/auth/me` has resolved and the shell

  // rest a data scope on.

  // What crosses the wire is a timestamp, a boolean and a conversation id, all
  // of the record's own Coach thread. The Coach CHAT stays refused under a
