/**
 * The shell every Insights overview section paints its body on.
 *
 * Six sections had hand-rolled the same `bg-card … rounded-xl border p-4
 * md:p-6` literal, and the six copies had already drifted apart on the one
 * thing the literal did not pin: the inner rhythm. Three used `gap-3`, two
 * `gap-2`, one `space-y-4` — 8, 12, and 16 px between blocks, one under the
 * other in the same column. This primitive composes `<Card>` so the frame
 * comes from the card contract (radius, border, surface, `px-4 md:px-6`
 * inset, `py-4 md:py-6`) and pins the inner rhythm at one step: `gap-3`.
 *
 * Outer geometry is unchanged from the literals it replaces. What changes:
 * the two `gap-2` bodies open by 4 px, the `space-y-4` body tightens by
 * 4 px, and all six pick up the card's `shadow-sm` — which their `<Card>`
 * neighbours in the same column already had.
 *
 * Density lives here, never on a slot: `pt-*` on the content or `pb-*` on a
 * header fights the gap-based Card contract (lint-enforced).
 *
 * RSC-safe: no hooks, no browser API.
 *
 * @see docs/contributing/ui-standards.md §1
