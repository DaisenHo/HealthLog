/**
 * v1.12.6 — the one canonical tile header used by every Insights tile.
 *
 * Pre-v1.12.6 each tile hand-rolled its own `icon + heading` row at a
 * slightly different size, weight, and colour: the "Einschätzung" card
 * led with a foreground-colour icon + `CardTitle`, the target panel led
 * with a small muted `Target` glyph + a range string, and the stat strip
 * led with a tiny uppercase muted caption. Side-by-side on the same
 * subpage they read as three different card languages.
 *
 * `TileHeader` pins the single header contract to the "Einschätzung"
 * reference (the calmest, most legible of the three): a `flex
 * items-center gap-2` row with the icon and the `CardTitle` BOTH in the
 * foreground colour (white in dark mode) — never `text-muted-foreground`
 * — at `text-base`, icon `h-5 w-5 shrink-0`. An optional `right` slot
 * carries a trailing affordance (a provenance / tooltip glyph, a status
 * pill) without breaking the row's alignment.
 *
 * RSC-safe: no hooks, no browser API, so it renders on the server inside
 * any client or server tile.
