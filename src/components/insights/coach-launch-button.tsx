/**
 * Inline desktop Coach launch button.
 *
 * v1.4.28 — the legacy implementation rendered BOTH a sticky FAB
 * (visible `<lg`) and the inline pill (`lg+`) from the same component.
 * Every sub-page that mounted `<CoachLaunchButton>` therefore painted a
 * second FAB into the DOM, collapsing to one visible button only
 * because of `fixed` positioning — the duplicates still landed in the
 * a11y tree. The FAB now lives once at the layout level (see
 * `<LayoutCoachFab>` in `src/app/insights/layout.tsx`); this component
 * keeps only the inline `lg+` pill that sub-pages mount inside their
 * action rows.
 *
 * The button is a thin wrapper around `useCoachLaunch()` — it only
 * renders when the context provider is mounted (so dropping the button
 * onto a non-Insights page is a no-op rather than a crash).
