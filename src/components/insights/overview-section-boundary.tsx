/**
 * One Insights overview section, fenced.
 *
 * The overview is a stack of independent sections, each with its own read.
 * A section that fails to load already shows its own error row; this fence
 * covers the other failure, a section that throws while rendering (a payload
 * shape it did not expect, a chunk that no longer exists after a deploy).
 * Without it the throw reaches the route boundary and replaces the whole
 * page, so one broken card takes the hero, the scores and every other
 * section down with it. Inside the fence the failed section becomes one row
 * with a retry, and the rest of the page stays.
 *
 * Retry clears the fence and renders the section again; a section whose
 * failure was transient comes back, one whose failure is permanent shows the
 * row again.
