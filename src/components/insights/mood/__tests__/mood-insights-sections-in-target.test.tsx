/**
 * v1.8.6 — the in-target share must appear exactly once on the mood
 * page. The canonical surface is `<MoodInTargetTile>`; when it renders
 * (inTargetPct present) the same-number `in-target` takeaway is dropped
 * from the narrative feed so the percentage is not duplicated one row
 * below the headline tile.
 *
 * Driven against `<MoodInsightsBreakdowns>` rather than its parent since the
 * breakdown cluster moved into its own `next/dynamic` chunk: under a static
 * render the parent paints the loader skeleton and nothing this file is about
 * is in the markup. The breakdown module takes the resolved payload as a prop,
 * so the aggregate no longer has to be seeded into a query cache to reach the
 * assertion. The provider and the auth stub stay because the "what stands
 * out" card inside the cluster fetches the discovery surface itself.
