 * Opening, stepping and closing the day layer from anywhere in the app.

 * the browser's Back closes the layer and Forward opens it again; Next keeps
 * `useSearchParams` in step with those writes, and the layer mounted in the
 * shell reads the parameter and nothing else. Stepping to the neighbouring day
 * replaces the entry instead of adding one, so five steps still need a single
 * Back to leave. Opening another day while one is open (a second chart point
 * beside the docked panel) swaps the day the same way.
 *
 * Two things do not belong in the URL and live here for the length of one
 * open: the value the person tapped to get here (the focus card at the top of
 * the day) and the element that opened the layer, which gets the focus back
 * when it closes.
