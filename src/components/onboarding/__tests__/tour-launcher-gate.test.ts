/**
 * v1.4.47 — onboarding chain gate.
 *
 * `<WelcomeCarousel>` (gated on `users.onboardingCompletedAt`) and
 * `<TourLauncher>` (gated on `users.onboardingTourCompleted`) used to
 * both auto-launch when null. A brand-new user finished the carousel
 * and was immediately greeted by the spotlight tour — ~90 seconds of
 * forced onboarding before they could touch the dashboard.
 *
 * The fix turns the tour into "the second-visit thing": auto-launch
 * is suppressed until `onboardingCompletedAt + 24 h`. This file pins
 * the pure decision helper so a future refactor doesn't silently
 * regress the gate. v1.18.6.1 — the tour is first-time-auto-start
 * only; the former "manual restart from Settings" bypass was removed.
