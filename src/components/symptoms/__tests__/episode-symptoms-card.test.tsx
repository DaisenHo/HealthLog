/**
 * The "Symptoms logged" card on an illness episode's detail page (#1237).
 *
 * An occurrence belongs to an episode when it is filed against it
 * (`SymptomEvent.episodeId`), not when it merely happened while the episode
 * ran. Before the fix the card also read every occurrence inside the
 * episode's onset-to-recovery span, so a long-running condition listed the
 * symptoms of every illness overlapping it and the person's choice in the
 * "during" selector changed nothing on the page.
 *
 * Mutation checks (each run, each seen red):
 *   - read the span as well and merge it in (the pre-fix card) → "lists only
 *     the occurrences filed against this episode" goes red (the unrelated
 *     headache shows);
 *   - drop the `episodeId === episode.id` guard → "never shows another
 *     episode's occurrence" goes red.
