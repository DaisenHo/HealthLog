/**
 * v1.37.0 — what a refused accept, revoke or renounce says, and where it says
 * it.
 *
 * ## The state this replaces
 *
 * These three mutations had no failure rendering at all. They fired, the
 * server answered 409 or 410, or the request never left the machine, and the
 * panel did nothing — the confirm dialog had already closed, the list did not
 * change, and the only signal was the absence of one. The two refusals that
 * matter most were the two that arrived most quietly: an invitation that had
 * lapsed, and the last Guardian being refused a renunciation that would leave
 * a managed profile with nobody looking after it. Both are recoverable, and
 * neither is recoverable by somebody who was not told.
 *
 * ## Every arm names its own recovery
 *
 * A refusal is only worth rendering if it changes what the person does next,
 * so the sentences are split by what the next step is rather than by status
 * code. "Lapsed" leads to asking for a new invitation; "withdrawn" leads
 * nowhere and says so; the last-Guardian refusal names the two ways out the
 * lifecycle actually offers. The offline arm is the one where retrying IS the
 * recovery, so it is separated from a server refusal even though both surface
 * as a failed mutation: a request that never left the machine changed nothing,
 * and telling somebody their access "could not be ended" when it was never
 * asked is a different and worse sentence.
 *
 * `ApiError` carries the server's stable `meta.errorCode`; anything that is
 * not an `ApiError` never reached a response at all, which is what makes the
 * offline test a type check rather than a status check.
