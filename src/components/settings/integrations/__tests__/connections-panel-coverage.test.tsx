/**
 * Nothing on the envelope may render nowhere.
 *
 * A provider whose Settings card was removed kept its cron, its ledger row and
 * its block on the status envelope, and lost the only surface that could have
 * shown it dying. It then stopped syncing for a month and no screen anywhere
 * said so — every audit that went looking worked from the cards, so a provider
 * without a card appeared in no cohort at all.
 *
 * The panel's unit of coverage is therefore the envelope entry, not the card.
 * This is the acceptance test in executable form: render the panel with an
 * envelope carrying every integration key, and require that each configured
 * one surfaces either as a bespoke card or as a fallback row.
 *
 * That provider was retired in v1.32.33, so the card-less case no longer has a
 * live instance. It keeps a synthetic one — the fallback row has to be proven
 * working before the next card is dropped, not after.
