            gap in row 2.

            The sticky lives on the `<aside>` grid item itself, with
            `self-start` so it shrinks to its content instead of stretching
            to the full row height. A sticky CHILD inside a stretched grid
            item resolves its containing block to the stretched item, which
            in some engines lets the nav scroll away with the content rather
            than pin. Sticking the grid item directly — sized to content and
            offset `top-6` to clear the scroll viewport's padding — keeps the
            nav fixed while only the content column scrolls. `max-h` +
            `overflow-y-auto` let a long section list scroll within the
            pinned panel on short viewports. */}

            v1.25.11 (#154) — the column no longer carries its own
            `min-h-[calc(100dvh-12rem)]`. That reserve was tuned without
            the AuthShell wrapper's `pt-6 pb-20` (104 px) in the budget, so
            on a short section it forced the column ~100 px past the
            viewport: the page scrolled into a dark empty band below the
            last card. Instead the GRID carries `md:min-h-[calc(100dvh-
            10.5rem)]` (top bar 4rem + wrapper pt-6/pb-20 = 10.5rem), and
            this column is the grid's `1fr` row, so it stretches to fill
            the viewport EXACTLY on a short section (no over-scroll, no dark
            band) and grows past it on a long one (normal scroll). The floor
            still prevents the short-loading-state → long-list height jump
            the old reserve guarded, just measured against the real budget.

            The column carries NO bottom gutter of its own. AuthShell's
            `<main>` already reserves `pb-[calc(4rem+safe-area)]` on `<md` to
            clear the floating bottom-nav, and its wrapper reserves `pb-20` for
            the Coach FAB. The old `pb-24 md:pb-0` (v1.4.33 F14) double-counted
            that same 64 px nav clearance and stacked ~96 px of dead scroll
            below the last card on mobile — removed so the shell owns all
            bottom-space (over-scroll class, #154 lineage).

            v1.16.4 — a `<div>`, not `<main>`: the surrounding AuthShell
            already provides the page's single `<main>` landmark and a
            nested second one is an a11y violation. */}
