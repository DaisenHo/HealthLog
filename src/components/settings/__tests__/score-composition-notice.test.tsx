/**
 * The settings half of the composition note.
 *
 * Its subject is the one change on this page nobody made: the person did
 * not touch the rows below it, the method did not move, and the number is
 * different anyway. So the two things worth pinning are that it names the
 * pillars in the reader's own language, and that it never borrows the
 * recipe note's sentences — telling someone they changed something they did
 * not change is worse than saying nothing, which is what shipped before.
