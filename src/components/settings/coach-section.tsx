/**
 * v1.18.0 — Settings → Coach.
 *
 * The Coach preference cards moved out of the AI / Assistant section into
 * their own dedicated entry so the AI section owns only provider / model /
 * BYOK configuration. This section gathers the Coach-specific surface:
 *
 *   1. Coach state       — on or off, with a link to the one switch in
 *                          Settings > Modules (v1.44: the second switch that
 *                          used to sit here is gone; kept first so a person
 *                          who wants the surface gone finds the way at once).
 *   2. Coach preferences — tone, verbosity, data scope (`useCoachPrefs`).
 *   3. Proactive nudges  — a pointer to Settings > Notifications, where the
 *                          nudge card lives with the other reminders since
 *                          v1.44 (`#coach-nudge` forwards there).
 *   4. Coach memory      — durable-fact review + forget controls.
 *
 * The nav entry is module-gated on `coach`. The preference + nudge cards
 * keep their own content gate on the same published module state
 * (`user.modules.coach`, resolved by the server for the record on screen
 * from that record's opt-out and the operator's switches): hiding the Coach
 * hides its tuning. The raw `disableCoach` column is the signed-in person's
 * own, so inside a managed or shared record it answered for the wrong
 * person. The memory (facts, stored conversations and reminders) is never
 * gated: it is the person's own record, readable and deletable whatever the
 * Coach's state. The reminders card turns read-only while the Coach is
 * unavailable and, with the Coach hidden, shows only when rows exist.
 *
 * The "about me" context lives in the AI section, not here — the daily
 * briefing reads it too, so it is not a Coach-only setting.
 *
 * v1.18.6 — the visible heading + subtitle now come from the shared
 * `<SettingsSectionFrame>` in the route; this body is the Coach cards only.
