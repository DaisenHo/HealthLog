# migrate-demo-edge01.sh

Copies **exactly one** user — the demo account
`usr_demo_cf31025295714ece8d91f5af13afd76d` — from the production apps01
Postgres to the **separate** edge01 demo Postgres. No other user's rows are
transferred under any circumstance.

> Review the script first, then run it deliberately. It performs destructive,
> demo-scoped deletes on the edge01 demo DB, then loads the apps01 demo slice.
> It never writes to apps01 (source is read-only).

## How it connects

- **Source (apps01):** SSH alias `apps-01`, container `db-pg8wggwogo8c4gc4ks0kk4ss`
  (stable), psql `healthlog`/`healthlog`.
- **Target (edge01):** SSH alias `edge-01`. The demo Postgres is a separate
  Coolify resource whose container name is **not hardcoded** — the script
  resolves it at runtime via `docker ps | grep -iE 'postgres|^db-'` and aborts
  if it cannot pick a single match (override with `DST_DB_CONTAINER=db-xxxx`).
  The demo **app** uuid is `ck8cs4osswg8w440gskw08w8`; match its linked
  Postgres resource, not the docs/landing DB.
- **Edge demo user id is resolved at runtime** by `username='demo'` (it may
  differ from the apps01 id). The wipe phase is scoped to that resolved id; the
  load then brings the apps01 row in, so afterwards the edge01 demo user
  carries the apps01 canonical id.

Each table is transferred with a scoped, server-side `\copy ... TO STDOUT`
piped host-to-host into `\copy ... FROM STDIN`, using **explicit column lists
on both ends** so secret columns can be NULLed and column order is pinned.

## Secret / credential columns NULLed on the `users` row

`codex_access_token_encrypted`, `codex_refresh_token_encrypted`,
`codex_token_expires_at`, `codex_connected_at` (and `codex_connection_status`
reset to `'disconnected'`), `ai_anthropic_key_encrypted`,
`ai_local_key_encrypted`, `ai_openai_key_encrypted`,
`withings_client_id_encrypted`, `withings_client_secret_encrypted`,
`whoop_client_id_encrypted`, `whoop_client_secret_encrypted`,
`fitbit_client_id_encrypted`, `fitbit_client_secret_encrypted`,
`telegram_bot_token`, `telegram_chat_id`,
`insurance_number_encrypted`, `insurer_name`, `insurer_ik_number`.

Forced flags: `telegram_enabled=false`,
`role='ADMIN'`.

**Overwritten:** `password_hash`. The row arrives carrying the source
account's hash, and the load is immediately followed by an `UPDATE` that sets
the Argon2id hash of the demo password the README publishes, then asserts the
stored value matches it byte for byte and aborts if it does not. The source is
the operator's own instance, so its demo password can be rotated at any time;
carrying that hash across is what silently broke the advertised demo login in
issue #805. The statement travels on psql's stdin, never inside the ssh command
string, because the hash contains `$argon2id` / `$v` / `$m` / `$t` / `$p`
segments that a remote shell would expand to nothing.

**Kept:** `avatar_bytes` /
`avatar_content_type` / `avatar_updated_at` (profile photo), and all
display / preference / layout JSON (`thresholds_json`,
`dashboard_widgets_json`, `insights_layout_json`, `coach_prefs_json`,
`source_priority_json`, `doctor_report_prefs_json`, `notification_prefs`,
`healthkit_config_json`, unit prefs, `height_cm`, `gender`, `timezone`,
`locale`, `date_of_birth`, `display_name`, onboarding state, research-mode
acknowledgement).

## What is excluded — and why

- **Auth / device / push** (sessions, passkeys, auth_challenges, api_tokens,
  refresh_tokens, devices, push_subscriptions, push_attempts,
  notification_channels, notification_preferences) — per-environment, never
  portable.
- **Integration / OAuth** (withings/whoop/fitbit connections, all
  `*_oauth_states` / `*_connect_tickets`, telegram scheduled-deletions +
  reminder messages, clinician_share_links, provider_health) — tied to live
  credentials.
- **Encrypted-at-rest payloads we can't decrypt on edge01:**
  `insight_narratives` and all `coach_*` (coach_conversations, coach_messages,
  coach_facts, coach_usage). The edge01 instance does not hold the prod
  encryption key, so the AES-256-GCM ciphertext would be unreadable. The same
  reason drives NULLing `cycle_day_logs.sensitive_encrypted` /
  `notes_encrypted` while still carrying that table's plaintext cycle fields.
  The plaintext AI assessment text is preserved through the `insights.%`
  `audit_logs` rows (the text lives in the `details` JSON) instead.
- **Transient / regenerable:** idempotency_keys, rate_limits, data_backups,
  import_jobs, host_metrics, feedback, recommendation_feedback, and all rollup
  tables (measurement_rollups, mood_entry_rollups, strain_trimp_cache,
  cycle_predictions) — these
  rebuild on edge01.
- **No rows:** workouts / workout_routes / workout_samples (demo has none).
- **Instance / global:** app_settings; global catalogues (mood_tags,
  cycle_symptoms) — these pre-exist on edge01 and the carried link rows
  reference the global ids only.

## Encryption note

The edge01 demo instance is assumed **not** to share the apps01 encryption
key. Every column whose value is AES-256-GCM ciphertext under the prod key is
either NULLed (secrets on `users`, `cycle_day_logs.*_encrypted`) or skipped
entirely (`insight_narratives`, `coach_messages.encryptedContent`). Carrying
that ciphertext would produce undecryptable rows that the app's fail-closed
loader would reject.

## role = ADMIN + DEMO_MODE expectations

The demo user is loaded with `role='ADMIN'` so the admin surfaces are
viewable in the demo. This is **only safe because DEMO_MODE must stay ON** on
edge01 — the proxy layer (`src/proxy.ts`) blocks every mutating request in
demo mode, so an admin demo session can browse admin pages but cannot change
anything. If DEMO_MODE were ever off on edge01, this admin demo account would
be a write-capable admin. Keep DEMO_MODE enabled.

## Safety mechanisms built into the script

- `set -euo pipefail` and `ON_ERROR_STOP=1` on every psql call.
- **Pre-flight guard (apps01):** for each carried set, a query that must
  return `0` foreign-owned rows — aborts on any non-zero. Includes a check
  that the demo owns **0 custom mood_tags** (so every carried
  `mood_entry_tag_link` points at a global tag that pre-exists on edge01) plus
  a defensive "non-global tag" link count.
- **Scoped wipe-first (edge01):** FK-child-first deletes, every one scoped to
  the runtime-resolved edge01 demo id. No unscoped delete anywhere. Refuses to
  proceed if `username='demo'` on edge01 resolves to the operator id.
- **Post-load verification (edge01):** per-table demo row counts; a hard
  assertion that the operator id `cmlupy4tn000001rpzx1pxvz7` appears in zero
  rows; a check that user_id-bearing carried tables hold only the demo id; and
  a confirmation the demo user exists with `role=ADMIN`.

## Caveats / things to confirm before running

- **`FOREIGN_HITS` assertion** counts _all_ non-demo rows in the carried
  tables on edge01, not just what this run inserted. On a clean
  single-demo-user DB it is `0`. If edge01 legitimately hosts other demo-only
  accounts, treat a non-zero value as a warning to inspect, not an automatic
  failure (the script prints it as a WARNING, not an abort).
- Confirm edge01 psql credentials are `healthlog`/`healthlog` (the script
  verifies connectivity before any write; adjust `PG_USER` / `PG_DB` if the
  demo Postgres resource uses different ones).
- The script assumes edge01's schema is at the same (or a compatible) Prisma
  migration level as apps01. A column present on apps01 but missing on edge01
  fails the `\copy` loudly rather than silently corrupting data — run
  migrations on edge01 first if the two have drifted.
